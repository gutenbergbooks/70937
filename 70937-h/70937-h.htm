<h2 class="nobreak" id="intro">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>S one of the pioneers in the most wonderful
art-science of the age—the motion
picture industry—the writer feels doubly
qualified perhaps to throw some light upon a
subject equally interesting to author and producer.</p>

<p>A few years ago to the uninitiated “moving
pictures” spelt little more than pantomime,
buffoonery or sensational catch-penny device.
To-day, there are few who maintain this view,
and they are the unenlightened; for to the
vast majority of those familiar with the art
and interested in its progress, the word has
become symbolic of things important and far-reaching.</p>

<p>Literature is literally the basic foundation
upon which the already gigantic edifice of
picturedom has risen.</p>

<p>Ten or twelve years ago picture manuscripts
were unknown—office boys, clerks,
camera operators, any one with an “idea”
furnished the material from which motion pictures
were produced. Plot was unknown,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span>
technique did not exist, and literary and constructive
quality was conspicuous by its absence.
The art, however, developed rapidly.
It was found possible to do more than portray
outdoor scenes of moving trains and other
objects, or simple pantomimes with exaggerated
gesture <i>à la Française</i>. Methods were
discovered and evolved whereby powerfully
dramatic scenes could be reproduced, subtilty
of expression in either serious or humorous
vein could be communicated to numberless
people—their emotions played upon, laughter
or tears evoked at will—in other words, the
Silent Drama was born.</p>

<p>Classic and standard literature was then reproduced
in photodrama. Shakespeare, Dickens,
Thackeray, Scott and Hugo became
known to millions of people whose previous
acquaintance with their famous works was
either very slight or non-existent. It was
at this stage, when literature was combined
with other arts allied in picture production,
that the real impetus was given and the triumphant
onward march of the world’s greatest
educator and entertainer commenced.</p>

<p>To-day, millions are invested in great industrial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</span>
plants for the creation and manufacture
of the wordless drama; thousands of people
rely upon it as their sole maintenance and
profession. Millions upon millions of men,
women and children all over the world look
upon this form of entertainment as their principal
recreation and, incidentally, are being
unconsciously educated to understand and appreciate
the higher forms of art.</p>

<p>Bernard Shaw says: “The great artist is he
who goes a step beyond the demand and, by
supplying works of a higher beauty and a
higher interest than have yet been perceived,
succeeds after a brief struggle in adding this
extension of sense to the heritage of the race.”</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the works of higher
beauty and interest accomplished by the real
artists in the motion picture profession have
been widely productive of the “extension of
sense” above quoted.</p>

<p>All this brings us to the practical purpose
of this discussion—the dissemination among
those who write of the intelligence that a new
and fruitful field is open for the works of
their pens. The short-story writer who gets
from one hundred to five hundred dollars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</span>
for magazine stories can get a similar amount
from the picture manufacturers; the authors
of international fame, who make thousands
in royalties, can make thousands more from
picture royalties—and in every case without
interfering with their magazine or book
rights. In fact, the greatest advertising a
novel could receive would be a preliminary
exhibition all over the world in pictures.</p>

<p>Many of the best modern authors have already
gone into this field and many more
will. For the day has arrived when, in addition
to producing well-known plays and successful
books, there is a need for big original
features, especially written for pictorial presentation.</p>

<p>The motion picture has narrowed the field
of the playwright, but there is another and
broader pasture awaiting both the play and
fiction writer when he has mastered the technique
of the “life portrayal.”</p>

<p>It is the writer’s belief that a gripping, compelling
story, hitherto unknown and unpublished,
<i>properly picturized</i> and bearing the
name of one of the best known writers of
modern fiction, would be a greater success<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</span>
artistically and financially than a revived
popular play or “best seller.” The words
“properly picturized” emphasized above are
significant.</p>

<p>The motion picture manufacturer stands to
the author in the position of publisher—he
needs you—you need him. There are good
and bad publishers. You, whose name is an
asset, would not deal with a publisher of
questionable methods; ergo, when seeking
out a market for your work, deal with none
but the highest class and best and old-established
motion picture concerns.</p>

<p>Picturedom is looked upon by many as the
New Eldorado. Many misguided fools are
rushing in where experienced angels fear to
tread. Many theatrical concerns are now
“going into the moving picture business,” and
they blithely announce their intention to uplift
the motion picture and show the public
some real stage productions done in pictures.
The few that have come to light so far have
been very sad affairs, as is but natural. The
average theatrical man makes about the same
brand of pictures as the average picture producer
made five years ago. To quote again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</span>
the invaluable Shaw, “Vital art work comes
always from a cross between art and life.”</p>

<p>The art of the picture is to convey an impression
of absolute realism in a manner
artistic. The theatrical stage manager has
been proven to be utterly useless in picture
production until he has unlearned all traditions
of the stage and acquired an entirely
new technique. It is unfortunate that many
stock-jobbing, security-selling schemes are being
offered to investigators and the public under
the magic “movie” name. Many royalties
are being promised that will never be paid and
of many of these cardboard houses great will
be the fall thereof. “A word to the wise is
sometimes money in pocket.”</p>

<p>All summed up in a paragraph, the answer
is, without a <i>story</i> motion pictures would be
what they were styled at their inception—a
novelty or a fad. So literature is indissolubly
linked with the future and success of the
greatest of the allied arts. The “life portrayal”
or “thought visualized” is perhaps
better than all “literature realized.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">FOREWORD</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>RITERS of fiction and dramatic
literature have been less apt to respond
to the call of a new literary vocation,
than a world-wide public has been ready to
flock to the appeal of a new dramatic art.</p>

<p>A wonderful event has come to pass in the
annals of dramatic literature thru the development
of cinematography. So wonderful indeed
was this new addition to the art of
effective dramatic expression, that even after
a decade of existence, scarcely a dozen successful
writers of literature had realized its
potentiality and had allied themselves with
the new drama.</p>

<p>The public’s first recognition of cinematography
was as a novel diversion. People
flocked to see these presentations that crudely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</span>
reproduced not merely static likenesses, but
moving realities, just as they had appeared
before the camera. In those early days only
the elemental reproduction of moving objects
was attempted. The photography was miserable;
the presentation itself a blurred, eye-racking
ordeal.</p>

<p>Luckily for the waning novelty, the possibilities
for the trick picture were suddenly
realized and cinematography took on a new
lease of life. But once the wonder, amazement
and speculation that surrounded the
unnatural phenomena of these animated
photographs wore off, they became deadly
monotonous for the mature mind. Once again
cinematography hovered near the abyss of
oblivion.</p>

<p>Something significant, however, had transpired:
the trick picture had blundered, as it
were, into the realms of misadventure and
laughter. Slap-stick farce supplemented and
finally succeeded the trick picture. Cinematography
as an entertainment acquired a tremendous
commercial impetus immediately. In
less than a year the puling infant became a
healthy youngster, and the five-cent theater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</span>
began to take its rightful place as “the poor
man’s playhouse.”</p>

<p>Thus we have arrived at the beginnings of
a need for a literature to provide for the
screen portrayals. What had previously been
the device of a moment or the conception of an
hour, on the part of some ingenious—or ingenuous—director,
together with the combined
aid of all concerned, now became a
matter of serious consideration in order more
nearly to meet and to co-operate with the
mechanical requirements of length of film,
speed of operation and duration of projection.
All products were “home-spun” and in no
way belied their crude sources. In a very
short while it was discovered that there were
surprisingly few funny ideas and situations
in real life. The comedy personalities of
clever actors were worked to death trying to
put something new into old, frowsy and
threadbare saws.</p>

<p>But a world-old, child-young desire had
been awakened. The now vast audiences
wanted to be told a story—logical, dramatic,
gripping, living! They did not quite realize—as
they never do—what they were clamoring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</span>
for, and the producers had paused aghast, as
tho conscious of the new and Silent Drama
that stood at that moment on the threshold
of cinematography.</p>

<p>The first cinematograph stories were humorous.
Most of them were pathetic—which
is the case when any but a story teller tries to
tell a funny story. The serious story was
attempted with even worse results. The arrogance
of the trained writer of fiction or of
drama and the price of the producer were
still beyond conciliation.</p>

<p>The first borrowings may have come in taking
excerpts from history to make the modest
spectacles that gave a new note to cinematography.
Suffice it to say, that soon familiar
masterpieces of fiction and dramatic literature
began to appear. The moment that the exhaustless
stores of literature were opened to
the needs of cinematography we may say that
the photodrama really had its inception. In
the voracious search for a story, borrowing
became more general, descending from the
greater to the lesser lights. At first, borrowings
were looked upon by both authors and
publishers almost good-naturedly. Not until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</span>
the intrinsic commercial value of literary
work, from a photodramatic point of view,
became obvious was the virtue of the copyright
called into effect.</p>

<p>Several successful suits by publishers
brought the fear of the copyright into the
producers’ hearts. The scenario editor and
the photoplaywright became a power from
that time on.</p>

<p>All said and done, a large percentage of
the photoplaywrights developed in the mechanico-commercial
atmosphere of the early
days of cinematography were bound to be
limited in their range of vision, in their conception
of artistic drama and in their ideas
of the needs of the ever-widening audiences.
From the five-cent show, with its audiences of
crude farce- and melodrama-loving people of
small or limited education, had sprung the
million-dollar theaters, including the rich and
poor, the learned and the ignorant, the young
and the old in their vast, changing throng of
patrons, demanding something always better.</p>

<p>Is it any wonder—with the heads of the
companies becoming wealthy magnates by the
hour—that many of them gave little thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</span>
to anything else but the income end of their
wonderful business, forgetting the output almost
to the point of killing the goose that laid
the golden egg? Many of these men had not
the slightest conception what the word drama
meant; altho their employees had grown up
with the business, yet they knew nothing of
those more cultured professions of literature
and drama. Drama to them meant only the
production of so many feet of “pictures.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, the consummate handlers
of plots, the trained writers of fiction and
dramatic literature, who had made writing
their profession and had given years of their
life to demonstrating their ability to make
men laugh and cry and wait, by means of
dramatic pictures on page or stage—they had
stood aloof. The studio-bred photoplaywright
smiled indulgently as tho an insuperable
barrier separated these literary mastodons
from their preserves; the writers
scanned the field arrogantly as tho viewing
the common herd. Neither was giving the
other his due.</p>

<p>It is true, many well-known writers have
failed as photoplay technicians; but it is even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</span>
more true that most photoplaywrights would
fail as writers of fiction or stage drama.</p>

<p>Thus we arrive at our point: photoplay
writing is a new profession, for the simple
reason that the photodrama is a new form of
dramatic expression, tho in many ways like,
yet in even more ways differing from, either
fiction or stage drama.</p>

<p>The studio-bred photoplaywright needs just
as much to study and to learn the valued art
of choosing, developing and completing the
dramatic idea artistically, as the writer of fiction
or stage drama needs to master the difficult
and effective technique of the photoplay.</p>

<p>The photodrama is more sophisticated than
either the writer of other forms of literature,
who dabbles with it, or the studio-bred photoplaywright,
who struggles with it, at first suspects.
Each new test of illusion that is put to
it has been met effectively, maintained realistically
and completed convincingly—providing
it has had the artistic co-operation of
director, actors and appropriate scenic effects.</p>

<p>It was but a natural consequence that years
of dearth of play material and practical apprenticeship
should have brought to the surface<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</span>
many promising photodramatists from among
the studios. While there have been a limited
number of plays effective from a purely artistic
standpoint, and depending thruout on
emotional situations, there have been thousands
upon thousands of productions, startling
because of dynamic spectacles, with
scarcely a dramatic suggestion outside of outlandish
peril. The clash of souls is lost sight
of in the orchestral crash of falling buildings;
the climax in the struggle of a heroic spirit is
hidden behind locomotives coming head-on
and smashing themselves into junk; the pathetic
twilight closing over some wonderful
character depiction is lost in the glare of a
bona-fide fire advertised to cost thousands of
dollars. These are melodramatic sensations,
not drama.</p>

<p>Just as the average person can seldom appreciate
a startling sensation except for the
first time, so we find producers, directors and
audiences clamoring for something new and
surpassing all that has gone before, resenting
repetition or spectacles that are keyed below
the highest pitched sensation they have already
witnessed. One visit to the circus a year suffices<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</span>
most people; tho few of us are contented
with a weekly attendance at the theater with
the promise of a good drama. Dramatic revivals
are always welcome.</p>

<p>And so we see the feverish daily change of
program, and films that flare for a day and
then, like the reams of cheap reading trash of
the hour, are literally thrown into the waste-basket
and justly perish.</p>

<p>Many problems have been met with wonderful
facility in this new art. The actor, for instance,
has had to mould himself to new requirements,
demanding of him oftentimes a
more exquisite art than the spoken drama
comprehends. A vast number of actors have
acquired something near perfection.</p>

<p>A power has risen in the production of the
photoplay, however, that has often hampered
the progress of the new drama. All authority,
in too many instances, has been given to the
director. Even tho the meaning of the word
classic was as remote from his understanding
as the study of astronomy, yet all manuscripts
were subject to his interpretation, alteration
and elimination, from “Lucile” to “Lear.”
Too often actors en masse have had no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</span>
further intimation of what they were doing
than the vociferous bellowings of a director
beyond the camera. Thus was the writer deprived
of his most necessary ally in the interpretation
of his finer dramatic ideas. If many
directors cannot “see,” and possibly perceive
every scene and situation of a manuscript with
all their five senses, they have been known to
return it to the author as “impossible for production.”
In true drama our five senses—in
photodrama but one, sight—merely act as the
agent of the emotions, the real participant in
the drama.</p>

<p>The photodrama is bound to be taken seriously
in the end. We have theaters, we have
actors, manufacturing plants, we have a world-wide
audience—but no vital drama worth
mentioning yet. When we are supplied with
good plays the millennium of the photodrama
will begin, which, in its universality, will
eclipse anything known in the realms of
artistic expression. The photodrama needs
thinkers, not tinkers. There must come writers
with ideas as well as methods. The future
has room only for swayers of world-wide
emotion, and not mere footage producers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</span>
The trained writer has only a slight advantage
over the untrained writer, because he
must reject all his well-grounded rules of
fiction and dramatic technique. The novice
has a better chance in photoplay writing than
in any other field of expression, providing
he is mentally and temperamentally equipped
to take it up.</p>

<p>Photoplay writing is bound to become a
dignified profession despite the obloquy that
seemed to rest upon it for so long. But the
photoplaywright must elevate himself thru
his artistic product and thru a demand for
recognition of meritorious work by appropriate
compensation and also by credit of his
name to appear on the screen as author of
his plays.</p>

<p>It is to further these high aims in the realization
that the photodrama needs students
earnest in their desire to become honest artisans
and true artists—that this book has been
written by an ardent student of the new art.</p>

<div class="blockquot less">

<p>THE PREMISE OF ALL ART; THE BATTLE OF NEW
STANDARDS; THE DRAMA OF THE EYE; NOT
“MOVING PICTURES”; ALL THE WORLD’S THE
STAGE; A FIELD WITHOUT LIMITATIONS.</p>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N all expressions of true art we find the
portrayal of a message from the soul, mind
and emotions of one man to those of his fellows.
The message may be graven in stone,
wrought in iron, blended in color, soaring in
song, poured thru a pen, or spoken from the
stage. If it be art none may pass by without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
a portion of it entering his soul and enriching
his experience.</p>

<p>There is one essential condition, however,
that precedes all participation in, and mutual
enjoyment of, art—only true believers may
enter the shrine of complete illusion. The observer,
the reader, the listener, the participator
in a work of art, must concentrate the attention
of his body, mind and soul upon the emotional
message it contains, regardless of the
artificial mediums employed in giving it material
existence. For art consists simply in an
endeavor to express thru an outward and visible
symbol some inward and spiritual truth,
or struggle.</p>

<p>All new and unfamiliar forms of art, therefore,
are subject to superficial criticism, if not
ridicule, on the part of the uninitiated, who
either fail, or refuse, to see the underlying
truth interpreted by a work of art. Upon being
shown one of the splendid marbles of
Angelo they see but a piece of chiseled stone
and not the wonderful vision that inspired the
artist. To them one of Turner’s symphonies
of color is but a daubed canvas.</p>

<p>But once let appreciation of art values become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
part of a people’s understanding, and
the glories of a new and more wonderful
world is opened to them, which brings us
to the conclusion that there is a division of
opinion regarding even the Fine Arts—some
of which are patronized by the few, others are
participated in by the many. Among the latter
we find the devotees of fiction and dramatic
literature far outnumbering all others. The
reason, without doubt, for the wider popular
approval of these two mediums of artistic expression
lies in their portrayal of a segment
of life with all the vicissitudes, settings, characters
and contributing elements that lead to
its dramatic climax, as opposed to the single
static incident that the artist has limned in
stone or wood or on canvas.</p>

<p>Stage drama takes even a step in advance
of fiction literature in its approximation of
realistic illusion. The characters of the play
become the breathing, living, walking and
talking persons conceived by the playwright
and anticipated by the audience. Audiences
laugh and weep, rejoice and sigh, despite
themselves, wherever good stage drama is
offered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>Thus we come to the inception and introduction
of a new medium of artistic expression
that is destined to be numbered among
the Fine Arts. While the Photodrama is
closely allied and dependent upon both Fiction
and Dramatic Literature, yet it has a construction,
an expression, and a production so
uniquely its own that it is even more unlike
than like its allied sources. The Photodrama
is notable, too, in being science’s first contribution
to the Fine Arts.</p>

<p>The Photodrama has had to fight its battle
of the new standards. The day was when we
scoffed at the possibility of a mere animated
photograph making an artistic appeal to us
sufficient to stir our emotions. The conquest
of the lighter emotions is already a reality,
as any one may learn who will take the trouble
to step into a photoplay theater while a good
comedy is being run. But the supreme test
of the appeal of art—the drama that loosens
the treasured tears of a self-conscious, conservative
audience—is still the unattained, but
attainable, goal of the new profession.</p>

<p>Too often the message of fiction or stage
drama is limited, by the printed or spoken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
word, to the understanding of one’s own people;
but the drama of the screen is told in
terms of world-wide action, spelt in a tremor
of world-old emotion, and writ in the simple
language of the human heart—regardless of
culture or color, clime or creed. He who has
eyes to see may readily understand.</p>

<p>HOW PHOTODRAMA DIFFERS FROM STAGE DRAMA
IN CONSTRUCTION, TECHNIQUE AND EXPRESSION;
ALSO FROM FICTION CONSTRUCTION
AND NARRATION IN GENERAL AND THE
SHORT STORY AND THE NOVEL IN PARTICULAR.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE very first impulse that comes to the
photoplaywright, as a true exponent of
literary art, must be stifled—he cannot clothe
his message in glowing words that will ravish
the ear and please the eye of an esthetic public.
Rather, he must construct a silent, technically
wordless picture. He must smother his vocabulary
under a mass of technique. He must
hide the light of his diction under a bushel
of “business.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, there must be the message to
radiate, the story to tell, the gratifying material
for entertainment. Granted an idea
worth artistic exploitation, there remains the
exercise of one of the most difficult processes
known to literary or dramatic construction.</p>

<p>A photoplay is composed primarily of mechanical
units, technically termed reels. A
full reel consists of 1,000 feet of film and occupies
approximately twenty minutes to display
its contents upon the screen. By contents,
we mean to include everything that is projected:
trade-mark frame of manufacturer,
including title of play and name of the author;
cast of characters, with Board of Censorship
notice at the end. The foregoing take approximately
two minutes of valuable time and are
merely incidental to the play. They concern
the writer only in so far as they act as limitations.
The essential photodrama itself includes
portrayal of dramatic action of the
characters; printed words contained in captions
and inserted dialog; close-views for the
purpose of emphasis; inserted printed matter
bearing upon the unfolding of the story.</p>

<p>We find a distinct advantage in the construction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
of the short stage play over that of
the short photoplay in the fact that the former
permits us approximately as long a time for
its single scene as we are allowed for the entire
photoplay composed of from 25 to 60
scenes! Again, the short stage play is merely
episodical in an intensive sense, developing a
single dramatic situation to an immediate and
effective climax; while the short photoplay is
usually expansive in character, comparable to
the wider boundaries of the short story in selecting
a supreme dramatic moment in the life
or lives of characters and portraying even the
remote cumulative incidents that began, contributed
to and compelled the climax, and possibly
containing many situations, tho of lesser
power than the climax itself. Aside from
the incidental employment of a mob now and
then, we may say that a vital characteristic
of the short stage play is economy, often two
and seldom more than five characters appearing
in the play. Because of its multiplicity of
scenes, however, the short photoplay normally
includes the employment of many extra characters
who establish and naturalize settings,
and seldom employs less than five important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
characters, for the reason that frequent change
of scene is necessary to photoplay development
and effect.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 1.</i>) <i>In a short photoplay it may
be necessary for our hero to visit his club, to gamble
and to lose the money that he is holding in trust.
While he and the villain, his opponent in the game,
are the two principal characters, it is essential to
introduce many others to make the club-setting
natural. We might call these “setting characters.”</i></p>

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 2.</i>) <i>We must always take into consideration
those scenes that act as a foil for those
in which our principal characters appear in their
important situations. Photoplay scenes without the
prop of dramatic dialog begin to lose power after
being sustained for two or three minutes. New
power is provided by reverting to another scene that
has a direct cumulative bearing upon the scene in
hand. With but two characters, or only a small
group that must be kept together for effect, quick
changes would keep the characters moving unnaturally
fast.</i></p>
</div>

<p>An examination of the three-act, or long,
stage play and a comparison with either short
or long photoplay, likewise disclose some advantages
in favor of the stage drama. Each
act of the long play allows the playwright
approximately forty minutes in which to attain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
a desired effect, or about one hour and
twenty minutes of combined action in all. By
means of the condensed method and rapid action
of photoplay drama, we may often get a
three-act play into a single reel of photoplay
action, while a solid evening’s entertainment
may include several short plays, and one long
one, equivalent in itself to a meaty drama.</p>

<p>The great advantage of photodrama over
stage drama, however, lies in the playwright’s
privilege to fill in all essential action of the
most infinitesimal character in exactly the
order and degree of its occurrence, so that the
spectator gets everything first-hand and not
thru hearsay. Furthermore, the photoplay
begins at the beginning of things essential.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 3.</i>) <i>Stage drama, thru the use of
a few well-chosen phrases, will often make clear to
the audience the relationship between characters and
the cause for the struggle that is the basis of the
play. Photoplay construction takes us back to the
causal act, tho it may have happened months before
the opening of the bigger situations.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The great problem that confronts the photoplaywright
is how to make his story convincing
without words, how to interpret every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
emotion into pure action. He must learn the
truth of that axiom which states that “actions
speak louder than words.”</p>

<p>With fiction construction and expression,
the photoplay has much in common. The
short photoplay, as we have pointed out, is
expanded to practically the same degree as
the short story, while the multiple-reel, or long
photoplay, has within its scope the complete
and satisfactory dramatization of the novel or
many-volumed literary work, thus enriching
the dramatic field with new forms of surpassing
material which must forever have been
denied millions of people who abhor reading
even the glorious treasures of fiction literature.</p>

<p>The two fields—of fiction writing and
photoplay writing—diverge into opposite directions
the moment we discuss the narration
of one and the visualization of the other.
In fiction narration, we resort unequivocally
to words to express our inmost vision and
weave our story; in the photoplay our words
merely indicate the line of action. The effectiveness
to be gained thru descriptive writing
is barred to us; we must confine our description
to a line at the head of each scene. Fine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
paragraphs on introspection, or mental agony,
or deep feeling are helpless, unless they have
their counterpart in vivid action. Artistic narration
is a handicap; expressive vocabulary is
essential. We must express ourselves, then,
in terms of action rather than in periods of
rhetoric.</p>

<p>But does not the absence of the spoken
word make it easier to give expression to the
universal language of the heart? All motives
and emotions must be made to appear on the
surface. Even sounds must be silently, yet
effectively, portrayed. The music artist peoples
the imagination of his audience with a
glorious phantasmagoria. There is a music of
vision that delights the beholder of motion and
action, typifying life, health and sanity. We
have only to give photoplay art its premise
and we may find it ranked among the muses.
In artistic photodrama we perceive with the
ears of the heart and the soul, gifted, it would
seem, with a new soul organ. The day of the
skilled spectator must follow the dawn of the
art of the ideal interpreter.</p>

<p>TITLE; SYNOPSIS; CAST OF CHARACTERS; AUTHOR’S
REMARKS; SCENARIO; SCENE; SCENE-PLOT.</p>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>E find the presentation of the photoplay
in manuscript differing widely
from that of both fiction and stage drama, in
that it represents a mechanical point of view.
Whereas the entire fiction manuscript is submitted
verbatim as it will appear before the
reader, and the stage play manuscript contains
every word as it will be heard by the audience,
the photoplay manuscript contains only a few
lines of captions and possibly several inserts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
which alone of the actual manuscript will appear
on the screen.</p>

<p>The first item that appears on the manuscript,
the title, is coming more and more to
be regarded from its literary and story-fulfilling
point of view. We must ever bear it
in mind, however, chiefly as a commercial
asset. First, will it attract and reach the
pocketbook of the hesitating public and add
a drawing power to the poster displayed in
front of the theater? Second, will it successfully
compete with the ever-increasing number
of releases brought to the attention of the exhibitor
to choose for his daily or weekly
change of program? Third—and in a lesser
degree—will it appeal to the photoplay editor
because of its promise of high-class literary or
dramatic material? It is possible in nine cases
out of ten to combine all these desirable features,
but not without careful thought.</p>

<p>The synopsis of the photoplay is something
more than a mere synopsis, it is an abridgment,
a condensation of the scene contents.
To write a perfect synopsis requires the exercise
of rare literary skill. By this is not
meant rhetorical flow, but the power of such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
a choice and command of words that enables
the writer to reduce possibly several thousand
words of instructive scenario to a few hundred
words of suggestive synopsis without missing
a single essential point. There must be a
style of telling the photoplay story that is terse,
crisp and suggestive. There is a studio convention
that seems to have limited the length
of the synopsis to 250 words. It is unfair to
make a hard-and-fast rule governing the synopsis,
for the reason that most aspirants get an
erroneous impression. Experience demonstrates
that most clean-cut, vivid plots may
be perfectly delineated in a synopsis of even
less than 100 words. On the other hand, the
power of the slight play made great thru pure
dramatic artistry would suffer from a too brief
synopsis. The refined emotional play free
from all the coarser strain of exaggerated
melodrama and sensational spectacle would
sacrifice its finer points if it did not touch upon
them and reveal their beauty in the synopsis.
Employ as few words as you can to amplify
and completely tell the abridged story of your
play!</p>

<p>The synopsis is designed primarily for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
convenience of the editor or reader who takes
up your manuscript with a view to its acceptability.
The synopsis is its recommendation.
If it does not tell him all its dramatic possibilities
in a brief space, its opportunity is lost,
for the editor seldom has time or inclination
to peruse the scenario. Should the manuscript
meet with acceptance, the synopsis is
thereafter used as a guide for the director.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 4.</i>) <i>Showing how little side-lights
are thrown on character, and shades of emotion may
be revealed in the synopsis: “Frail, piquant Rosalie,
with whom Malcolm is in love, is often piqued because
he never comes to the point in anything....
Malcolm prefers to sit on the porch and dream of
his coming deed.... Douglas is a doer of things
and immediately carries out the music in his heart
in appealing words.”</i></p>
</div>

<p>The cast of characters should mention individual
characteristics if possible and clearly
show the relationships at a glance. The cast
is for the convenience of the director in computing
the number of players necessary, in
selecting actors for the parts according to
their talents and personal characteristics.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 5.</i>) <i>MALCOLM FRENCH....
(Lead).... In love with Rosalie; Artist, Dreamer.</i></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>
<p><i>ROSALIE.... (Ingénue-lead).... Piquant, impatient,
frail, flirtatious.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Characters that appear singly should be
mentioned singly; those appearing in groups,
or mobs, described en masse, so that the director
may form at a glance a comprehensive idea
of outlay in characters, costumes and possible
character props.</p>

<p>There should be a distinct part of each
photoplay manuscript known as “Author’s
Remarks.” These should be brief and contain
such helpful suggestions as a mention of the
period of the play, its locale, where ideal locations
may be found near particular studios,
the need of extraordinary properties and
where they might be obtained (possibly the
author might have in his possession a coin,
MS., or oddity), maybe the suggestion of
specific actors whom you have in mind for important
parts. Confine these remarks to 50
words or less.</p>

<p>The part of the manuscript next to appear
is the scenario, or enumeration of scenes, including
the respective action taking place in
each. After numbering the scene, a single line
is devoted to the description of the scene of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
setting. This is the only space permitted the
writer for description, and one or two words
are supposed to suffice unless he wishes a
certain arrangement of setting that will have
dramatic bearing on the development of the
action.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 6.</i>) <i>Scene 3—FRONT OF SHOP
(Window plainly lettered: J. CADWALLADER—ANTIQUE
JEWELS).</i></p>
</div>

<p>Despite the fact that it is the same in name
as a division of stage drama, a photoplay scene
is by no means identical with a stage play
scene. An apt parallel may be drawn by saying
that while a stage scene is all that is seen
and acted in one setting without dropping the
curtain, a photoplay scene is all of the setting
and action that is photographed without stopping
or changing the position of the camera.
If the position of the camera is changed an
inch, or if we should return to the same scene
a score of times, viewing it from the identical
point, it must bear another scene number and
be treated as a new scene. There is one exception
to this rule. When a scene is broken
by an insert or a close-view we “continue” the
scene, for the reason that the scene is not interrupted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
at all in the taking, the film being
cut to insert either close-view or other inserted
matter.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 7.</i>) <i>Scene 24.—INTERIOR PAWN-BROKER’S.
Broker takes necklace from case, examines
it, eyeing Douglas all the while, examines
jewels with jeweler’s glass, then turns, with shake
of head: INSERT 4.... “I DON’T RECEIVE
STOLEN GOODS. GET OUT OR I’LL CALL
THE POLICE!” Scene 24—(Continued). Douglas
slinks out with a scowl.</i></p>
</div>

<p>It is presupposed that every scene set down
in the manuscript is absolutely necessary, and
by necessary we mean essential to the cumulative
advancement of the play. The contents
of the scene itself consists of the writer’s process
of visualizing his story thru appropriate
directions for the movement of the characters
and a description of the resultant action,
vividly, tersely and suggestively <i>told in the
present tense</i>. The same economical care
should be practised in the selection of only
essential material and the rejection of unessential
details as one observes in the construction
of the short story. While the writer is
supposed to tell only what is to be done and
not to presume even to suggest how, yet there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
are many subtile emotions the perfect interpretation
of which he may have in mind. A
happy suggestion may often save the busy
and hurried actor or director time, and express
exactly what the writer has in mind instead
of making it necessary to guess at his
thoughts.</p>

<p>As the writer plans the effect to be produced
by his completed play, so he must keep
in mind a desired effect to be accomplished
by each scene. The length of a scene is determined
precisely by it attaining the single effect
for which it was created. Thus a scene
has a unity of its own which is comparable
with that of the complete play: Introduction,
or establishment of relationship sufficient for
the audience to grasp the significance of the
action; rising development; pronounced climax,
which is the signal for its termination—for
a scene never has a denouément. The
succeeding scene always carries the play a
step forward or higher.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 8.</i>) <i>Scene 52—ON THE BALCONY.
Malcolm singing with his whole soul in
his expression. Scene 53—JEWEL ROOM. Douglas
still kneeling before the cabinet, suddenly pauses,
his face contorted with painful memory.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>Much confusion would be eliminated, and
clearness and precision affected, if there were
a change in terminology calling scenes “acts,”
for they are distinct units of action and definite
and complete acts in the development of
the play. The scene, as its etymology indicates,
has primarily to do with the scenery or
setting. The same scene is repeated over and
over again, tho it always bears a new number.
The same act is never repeated (except
in facsimile in the vision scene), so that the
consecutive numbering of acts from beginning
to end of play would have a specific value, just
as the consecutive numbering of repeated
scenes is decidedly confusing.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">D</span>O not seek to write photoplays that are
sufficient in themselves and do not need
the aid of tricks of the trade, devices or artifices.
Such plays must need be crude because,
even tho perfect in plot, they are bound to appear
cut-and-dried, clipped and cured, and
wanting in all those little human touches which
by piercing the emotions and gaining the sympathies
of the audience, do more than win the
approbation of the mind. The impression that
the perfect play is the one which can dispense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
with any of the legitimate devices, no doubt
comes from a misconception of the precise
potentialities of these artifices. It is true, if
they do not serve as a means to an end; an
integral part of the play; units in the development
of the story; then they not only may,
but should, be dispensed with, by all means.
We employ nothing—property, actor, scene,
spectacle, spoken word, insert, incident or
device—in the perfect photoplay that has not
a bearing on the climax of the play.</p>

<p>The caption—variously miscalled leader,
sub-title, etc.—is the most necessary, the most
difficult and the most powerful of the illusory
agents employed in screening the dramatic
story. Its importance to the writer may be
reckoned from the fact that it is one of the
few small parts of the photoplay that is supplied
by the author and shown intact to the
audience. The caption is an action-title and,
like the chapter headings of a novel, portions
and savors the great bulk of the story and
collectively gives its gist.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 10.</i>) <i>Take, for instance, the captions
of “The Coming of the Real Prince” (Reliance),
and we have the big moments in the play that made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
it impossible for the audience to lose its vital significance:
(1) ANNIE’S WIDOWED MOTHER,
LEFT PENNILESS, OPENS A BOARDING
HOUSE; (2) THE DRUDGE; (3) ANNIE FINDS
SOLACE IN “CINDERELLA”; (4) THE DREAM
OF PRINCE CHARMING AND THE WONDROUS
CITY BEGINS; (5) “NO, BUD, I HAVE
GIVEN MY HEART TO A WONDERFUL
PRINCE;” (6) THE COMING OF THE PRINCE;
(7) THE FOLLOWING SUNDAY THEY GO
FOR A STROLL IN THE ENCHANTED
FOREST; (8) THE FAIRY TREASURE—HIDDEN
BY ANNIE’S MISERLY FATHER; (9)
THE PRINCE SEES AN EASY OPPORTUNITY
TO FILCH TWO TREASURES; (10) THE
FLIGHT TO THE WONDROUS CITY OF
DREAMS; (11) THE MAGIC AWAKENING OF
MOTHER-LOVE; (12) “FOR THE PRINCE
WAS A MIGHTY GOOD FELLOW!” (13) THE
GLORY OF THE PRINCE’S DOMAIN BEGINS
TO FADE; (14) “YOU WOULDN’T HAVE ME,
MOTHER, SO I DREAMED OF A PRINCE!”
(15) THE COMING OF THE REAL PRINCE...
And there’s the complete story, which any one with
imagination can readily fill out.</i></p>
</div>

<p>A play screened without captions or inserts
would be wanting in all the little human, intimate
and sympathetic touches that warm the
heart and pitch the emotions of the audience.
The figures that flitted thru the play, unintroduced,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">would be identified by the spectator as</span><br>
this or that actor, and not as Tess, or Mr.
Barnes, or Sherlock Holmes—all <i>characters</i>
of delightful memory. Pantomime sufficiently
powerful to suggest every relationship; costume
and accompaniments obvious enough to
establish every environment; and action violent
enough to interpret every emotion without the
aid of captioned or inserted matter, belong to
the elemental days of photodrama.</p>

<p>First of all, the caption should never be employed
to tell of an action that is to follow in
the scene, for a caption should never be used
if it is possible to translate its essence into
action:</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 11.</i>) <i>For instance, in the following
scene: Scene 56. JEWEL ROOM—Douglas has just
finished forcing open the door of the jewel cabinet
and holds the necklace in his trembling hand ... it
would have been superfluous to have captioned,
DOUGLAS STEALS THE NECKLACE.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Too often important points are unsuccessfully
left to the imagination of the audience
because they have been so clear in the mind
of the writer. Frequently these points are
essential to preserve an unbroken continuity,
yet too subtle to be conveyed by action, deduction,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
suggestion, inference, implication or
relationships.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 12.</i>) (a) <i>To economise, by getting
right into the pith of the story: ANNIE’S WIDOWED
MOTHER, LEFT PENNILESS, OPENS
A BOARDING HOUSE ... introduces us to
Annie and her mother, tells that her father has died,
they are penniless, they must work, the place we find
them in later is their boarding house.</i> (b) <i>To indicate
a lapse of time and tell what worth-while has
happened: THE SPRING COMES—AND WITH
IT HER PRINCE ... the previous scene had
been in the winter, Annie has been dreaming of her
prince and we might not have identified the weak,
flashy young man as such; the caption is, also, a link
in the suspense.</i> (c) <i>To communicate a mental or
psychological process: THE DREAM OF PRINCE
CHARMING AND THE WONDROUS CITY
BEGINS.... contains the very essence of the
climax and reveals the psychological trend of the
entire play.</i></p>
</div>

<p>We must bear in mind that there is something
more important than sequence of visible
action, and that is unbroken continuity or perfect
cohesion of story unity—of which every
intelligent audience is ever conscious—that
knows no such thing as gaps, breaks or
retrogressive movement. The caption is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
bridge that spans these and supports, quickens
and gratifies the imagination in addition.</p>

<p>The caption can be made to fulfill its most
artistic function by combining all the essential
qualities, already referred to, and also by serving
as the action-title for a complete sequence
of dramatic action. Thus one caption may
cover all the scenes in a sequence, each caption
adding a link in the development of the story
and all together giving the gist of the story
itself (as illustrated by Example 10). Thus
the caption becomes a distinctive aid in building
the dramatic plot, a contributory force in
its expression, and a gratifying parallel to
lead, guide and fulfill the action for the audience.
Captions are not labels, but means of
suggesting beyond the visible action and of
furnishing deeper motives than those on the
surface. There are beauty and harmony captions
which often add a poetic touch, or an
emotional tone, and intensify the dramatic
effect.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 13.</i>) <i>THE FLIGHT TO THE
WONDROUS CITY OF DREAMS ... but we
must take care that the poetic title is not a part of
the harshly realistic play, for we are seeking integral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
harmony. For example, in HELL—SECOND-HAND,
we find captions to suit the theme: 10 MINUTES
THIS SIDE OF ETERNITY! ... THE
LIFE-BLOOD RED FLAG.</i></p>
</div>

<p>An insert is filmed matter which is inserted
in the appropriate place in a scene, the film
being cut for this purpose. This matter must
appear and be known as an insert to the writer
and manufacturer only; to the audience, it
becomes the normal, logical and only natural
phenomena that could be presented under the
circumstances and sustains and strengthens
the illusion of reality. From the point of view
of the screen, an “insert” would suggest something
stuck in, or a patch; therefore it must
never be recognized as such except in the
workshop. Technically speaking, all inserted
matter is inserts. From a mechanical point
of view, the film must be cut in order that
captions, printed or inscribed matter, close-views,
visions, spoken lines, etc., may be inserted.
But we should ignore the manufacturer’s
construction and consider inserted matter
only as an essential to the perfect visualization
of our dramatic story.</p>

<p>The letter, telegram and newspaper insert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
are dangerous expedients to employ too frequently
in the artistic photoplay. They are so
easy to stick into a play that, like slang, they
become a ready makeshift for the lazy mind,
with results that are damaging to dignity.</p>

<p>We cannot repeat too often that everything
employed in the photoplay is done so with a
specific purpose, for a progressive effect, and
for no other reason. Likewise, it must bear
some cumulative and contributory relation to
the climax. Thus inserts and captions must be
something more than mere explanatory matter
by becoming important contributory data.</p>

<p>The insert is a great factor for economy,
and when properly used in this respect may
contribute to heightened effects thru suggestive
condensation.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 14.</i>) <i>The following letter insert not
only saves many scenes but teems with revelation:
“Dearest—You simply can’t stand it any longer.
Come with me to the city at daybreak. Meet me in
the office.” What it has told fills the gap; what it
promises because of this audacious proposal makes
the play.</i></p></div>

<p>The telegram is similar in character, only it
allows still greater condensation:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 15.</i>) <i>“Meet me in the office at daybreak.”
It serves as a further amplification of the
same example, tho there is an obvious inconsistency
in conveying such startling intelligence by wire.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The employment of the newspaper heading
and paragraph is a decided novelty in conveying
artistic data. The seeming awkwardness
of the medium must be overshadowed by a
simple and convincing naturalness on the part
of the character in obtaining information from
this source that strengthens its plea as dramatic
material:</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 16.</i>) <i>LIBRARY—Nelson enters with
tray containing letters and papers. Shelburne opens
paper, reads, pauses, laughs</i>:</p>

<p><i>INSERT O ... (News item heading)</i></p>

<p><i>WEALTHY SOCIETY WOMAN LEARNS
SHE HAS MARRIED BOGUS BARON</i></p>

<p><i>Scene (Continued)</i></p>

<p><i>Shelburne thoughtful. Mary steals in and places
her hand over his eyes. The fact disclosed in the
item wiped out all the past that stood between Mary
and Shelburne. The library scene was made more
natural by the reading of the paper and what followed
was inevitable. Neither the sense of the scene nor
any conceivable action alone could have told adequately
what really transpired. An insert alone filled
the purpose.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Perhaps the most effective use of the insert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
is to establish the premise of the plot, to cover
the causes leading up to the opening of the
play and possibly the relationship of the characters:</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 17.</i>) “<i>Dear George:—As I write this
I am preparing to run off with the Baron Komiskey.
To be frank, I’ve gotten tired of not seeing you take
any interest in anything. Forgive your former fiancée</i>,</p>

<p class="r"><i>PETRONELLA</i>.”</p>

<p><i>In which we see the characters of both Petronella
and George laid bare, besides furnishing a motive for
George’s change of character and future actions. This
insert breaks the first scene.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The theory of breaking scenes with inserts
has been discussed and has grounds for objections
from an optical point of view only. The
argument advanced against their use is based
on the persistence of vision with which the
eye retains for a considerable period the image
of that which has passed before it, obscuring
that which follows. This theory would become
seriously operative when applied to inserts
should we look upon them as extraneous
matter—as for example the vaudeville acts
that intervene between the parts of the long
photoplays produced in many of the variety
theaters. But, far from it, the ideal insert is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
contributory dramatic material that rather
precludes a possibility of gaps, jumps or discontinuity
of dramatic sequence. The perfect
insert emphasizes an otherwise too modest
period of action. Optical delusion is a negligible
quantity in the face of dramatic illusion,
which sweeps everything mechanical before it.</p>

<p>To speak of inserts as <i>explanatory matter</i> is
objectionable, because of the natural inference
that the story is to be interrupted and the
audience button-holed while a formal explanation
is inserted. Unless an insert becomes
essential <i>interpretive material</i>, quickening the
movement of the play and heightening the interest
in the story, something must be wrong
with the construction. Inserts should be
classed with all other forms of essential interpretive
material, such as expressive action,
gestures and attitudes; logical characters and
effective settings; and should be mercilessly
dispensed with unless they fulfill a specific
mission in carrying the story forward toward
an inevitable climax.</p>

<p>The term, close-view, makes a finer distinction,
signifying that an object or a portion of it
is magnified, or that a close-view of a segment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
of the action is seen on the screen at close
range by itself.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 18.</i>) <i>“.... Annie reads letter, a
great joy breaking over her face: INSERT LETTER....
“Dearest—Come with me to the city at
daybreak.”</i></p>

<p><i>In which the letter is presented for our perusal
with the same care that it would be inserted in a
story at the proper moment. It is part of the story.</i></p>
</div>

<p>In the same manner a calling card, an inscription
on a grave-stone, a monogram on a
ring, a miniature photograph, may be brought,
as it were, close to our eyes. The illusion is
ingeniously preserved by the presence of the
character’s trembling or tracing fingers following
the emotion in his soul.</p>

<p>The close-view, however, may take a step
farther than merely photographing an inanimate
object; it may dramatically emphasize a
segment of exquisite action.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 19.</i>) <i>INSERT CLOSE-VIEW of
title page of “Cinderella,” Annie’s trembling hand
tracing first word .... INSERT CLOSE-VIEW
of Annie’s face, she closes her eyes, her lips move
with a smile of ecstasy.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The close-view is indispensable for acute
emphasis; for peculiar dramatic effect; for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
discernment of some essential object too small
to be sufficiently noted or noticed otherwise;
for the display of the finer and more subtle
emotions; for the revealment of some otherwise
hidden object or action important in unfolding
the scene and developing the action.
The last named takes the same latitude as fiction
in bringing in essential data beyond the
discernment of the human eye. The optical
process, too, of looking at distant objects thru
a strong glass is effectively reproduced by the
close-view. A rather bizarre use is made of
the same device by showing a sectional view
of some inclosure:</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 20.</i>) <i>The hero may be eavesdropping
on the villain and be concealed in a box or a
barrel; this fact is disclosed by means of the sectional
view. Or a man crawling thru a tunnel and
shaking the earth beneath the scene of action.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The close-view has no equal for breaking
dangerously long scenes in a manner so natural
and potential that oftentimes it makes a
brilliant presentation of something that would
in all probability have become tedious.</p>

<p>The vision insert is treated more particularly
later on, under other captions. Suffice it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
to say, that the vision insert simulates the
more subtle mental processes of thought and
fantasy—such as reflection, introspection,
dreams and hallucination—that have a simultaneous
dramatic bearing on the conduct of the
character and on the psychological development
of the story.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 21.</i>) <i>CAPTION .... AFTER
FIVE YEARS WITHOUT HER.</i></p>

<p><i>Scene 31. Simply marked grave in cemetery.</i></p>

<p><i>Malcolm discovered kneeling, closes his eyes.
Fade to</i></p>

<p><i>INSERT VISION .... Reproducing scene 20 in
part (great rock above beach, etc.). Fade to</i></p>

<p><i>INSERT VISION CLOSE-VIEW .... Malcolm
looking intently at Florence, whose eyes disclose her
tender love for him. Fade to</i></p>

<p><i>Scene 31 (Continued) Malcolm has opened his
eyes, arms opened as tho to take Florence.</i></p>
</div>

<p>A helpful distinction between the simple insert
and the close-view insert—tho they are
both close-views, as a matter of fact—is to
designate all static and inanimate matter that
is neither alive nor in motion, as simple inserts;
and that which is properly part of the
action and has life, motion and expression, as
close-view inserts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 22.</i>) <i>Letters, telegrams, news excerpts,
printed, carved, engraved matter, miniatures
or other likenesses reproduced, and objects incapable
of automatic effort are simply inserts. Close-views
of a hand, face, or other part of the anatomy under
the stress of emotion, or merely revealing a contributive
peculiarity, remote objects with their contingent
action brought near, and fragments of action
isolated for emphasis, are close-view inserts.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The question of the employment of dialog
at all in the photodrama has been widely discussed.
It would seem to hinge on the meaning
of the word “dialog.” If the word is used
in its strict sense of “a conversation between
two or more persons,” then we may eliminate
it from the photoplay without further question.
The photoplay is no place for conversations.
But there are occasions upon which
the apt employment of a spoken line of dialog
has no equivalent or substitute. It becomes
one of the fine contributory elements that
establishes and preserves the illusion. The
effective use of the spoken line is usually as
an insert, being timed to appear simultaneously
with the representation of its utterance:</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 23.</i>) <i>To be precise, the insert follows
its actual utterance:</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p><i>Scene 23. Vine-covered arbor.</i></p>

<p><i>Follows business both pathetic and ludicrous of
Bud proposing: Annie smiles, shakes head.</i></p>

<p><i>INSERT SPOKEN LINE .... “NO, BUD, I
HAVE ALREADY GIVEN MY HEART TO A
WONDERFUL PRINCE!”</i></p>

<p><i>Scene 23. (Continued) Bud broken up but manly.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The spoken line is occasionally used also as
a caption, giving voice to the climacteric sentiment
or situation in a single scene, or series
of scenes, that follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 24.</i>) <i>CAPTION 6 .... “TO BE
HANGED BY THE NECK UNTIL DEAD!” is
followed by a courtroom scene. The nature of the
proceeding is obvious. The judge rises and pronounces
the conventional sentence of death that gives
dramatic significance to the entire sequence of action
that follows.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The spoken line has a poignant directness
in it that is scarcely equaled by any other
piece of business. The mental process should
be so cunningly imitated that the enthralled
spectator hears the words he craved just as
distinctly as tho they had beat upon the drums
of his ears instead of the drums of his soul.
The words pierce the spectator with personal
sympathy, or antagonism, and fairly thunder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
thru the silence. Like all other inserted matter
and devices, the spoken line must not be
used if it can be dispensed with to the artistic
betterment of the play. It must come naturally
and bridge a possible gap. It must be used as
a supplement to, not a substitute for, effective
action. Visualized action takes first and foremost
place in the photoplay; all other matters
are harmonious trappings and devices or illusion
that decorate creaking mechanics with
esthetic realities.</p>

<p>Inserted matter, unless artistically used, becomes
theatric instead of dramatic. It becomes
a sign of weakness and appears in the
same light as clumsy explanations in stories
written by inexperienced writers. The perfect
photoplay leaves no doubts, offers no explanations,
starts nothing it can not finish—it is all
action, <i>action</i>, ACTION! And by action we
mean technically visualized interpretation of
whatsoever nature that convincingly contributes
to the perfect illusion of emotionally
seeing a dramatic story.</p>

<p>ITS RELATION TO ACTION; IMPORTANCE OF
VOCABULARY; LITERATURE; TO REGISTER; INTERPRETATION;
IN TERMS OF EMOTION; THE
PART OF IMAGINATION.</p>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>ECHNIQUE and rules, idea and action
are as chaff on the threshing floor of
the photodrama compared to visualization,
which is the precious kernel to be sought.
Visualization is both the key and the keynote
of all photoplay-writing.</p>

<p>Hitherto, too much emphasis has been laid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
on the importance of action, with but a half-formed
idea of the true technical definition of
the term, which is “the connected series of
events upon which a piece depends; the main
subject or story, as distinguished from an incidental
action or episode.” Too often has
the novice had in mind the violent, whirling,
feverish and physical action, familiarized by
the “going into action” of the battlefield.
Such action is always dynamic and spectacular,
but not necessarily dramatic or interpretive.
Everything is on the surface. It is
all a matter of primal passion and primeval
emotion. It is the stuff that melodramas are
made of. But the deeper, more powerful and
moving emotions of a civilized people are not
surfacial. Their true interpretation is not expressible
in immediate violent action. Culture
and civilization are recognized and realized
thru their repression of passion. Even
the savage and the dumb beast have their refined
emotions, expressed most vividly thru
unwonted inertness or carefully concealed
cunning.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 25.</i>) <i>The eternal mother-heart
broods in dark corners over its dead offspring; it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
softly croons over and gently caresses its babe;
deepest hate is manifested by the savage or sage
thru cunning, soft-footed revenge and veiled thrust.</i></p>
</div>

<p>There are two sides to the technical difficulties
that confront the photoplaywright.
Given the conception of an idea worth while,
he must first have the power to visualize its
phenomena to himself; he must then be able
to represent its dramatic development visibly
in terms of action and symbols of emotion.
The power to visualize a story to one’s self
can neither be taught nor learned; its exercise
lies in the gift of imagination. The ability to
represent this story in a form that may be
readily interpreted depends on a practical assimilation
and a working knowledge of dramatic
construction and photoplay technique.
It resolves itself into the task of telling the
story indirectly with “business,” instead of by
direct discourse.</p>

<p>A careful examination of the conditions of
photoplay acceptance has revealed a curious
and valuable piece of information. An unusually
large percentage of the manuscripts received
by producing companies contain good
ideas, but they are very often rendered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
unacceptable because of imperfect and unilluminating
expression. The editor, the director
and the actor must understand from your
scenario <i>exactly</i> what action, interpretation
and suggestion your words are intended to
convey. Many big ideas, striking situations
and splendid scenes never see the light of the
screen because of the photoplaywright’s poverty
of expression.</p>

<p>A broad vocabulary hesitates at no flight of
inspiration, no matter how transcending; it
falters at no wave of emotion, no matter how
profound; it pauses at no thought, no matter
how beautiful. “Beyond words,” “inexpressible”
and “indescribable” are confessions of
literary and dramatic weakness that disappoint
editors and bring manuscripts back by return
mail. There are human words to express
every impression that the human mind records.
The language of the heart, of the soul and of
the photoplay is the language of the dictionary.
Familiarity with words begets fluency and accuracy
in their use. There is but one word
to express one situation under a given condition;
do not be content until you find it. That
diligence alone will make the finished and successful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
writer. Given inspiration, the right
words to express it will carry it to production,
perhaps fame.</p>

<p>Perfect visualization, then, demands an exquisite
command of language capable of nicely
interpreting the finest shades of pathos, the
deepest wells of passion, the most delicate
waves of emotion, and a thousand grades of
feeling.</p>

<p>Passing from the literary construction of
the manuscript and play, we must become
familiar with the mode of translating ideas,
which must be clearly indicated by the writer.
The three possible modes are by means of
psychological action, suggestive attitude and
mimetic expression. These are the elements
of the new mimetic art of the photodrama just
as the notes and keys are to music; words and
sentences to literature; pigments and brushes
to painting.</p>

<p>The secret of visualization lies in the nice
employment of symbols of emotion. The danger
lies in over-emphasis, which the writer can
forestall by using an indirect or relative
method, which means a constant exercise of
repression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 26.</i>) <i>A girl is made to show pity
for a sister-woman who is weeping because of some
fell blow. She does not go over and embrace her;
that would show sympathy and participation. Pity
comes into her face, her poise of the head, her wistful
attitude. And if sympathy, she would probably
stand with hand half-raised in helplessness if the
woman was bereaved. If some lighter grief, she
would gently caress the other and smile encouragement.
Gentleness is poignant!</i></p>
</div>

<p>It is the thoughtful addition of the little
human touches and scenes that makes the
great plays and gives appropriate expression
to great ideas.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 27.</i>) <i>In scene 8, of “The Coming
of the Real Prince,” we see Annie being driven
from the kitchen by her unfeeling mother. The gist
of the story would have been clear without dilating
on this sequence. But the tragedy in Annie’s heart
that was responsible for the play needed further
visualising, so we see Annie passing up the back
stairs with a broken-hearted look in her eyes; we
see her cast herself upon her miserable cot and sob
as tho her heart would break.</i></p>

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 28.</i>) <i>In scene 22, of the same play,
we see the very depths of Annie’s soul visualized.
First in the caption: THE DREAM OF PRINCE
CHARMING AND THE WONDROUS CITY
BEGINS. Annie, in grotesque position in bed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
beside battered lamp, reading “Cinderella.” Close-view
shows her face, with lips moving, an ecstatic
smile lightening her features. We return to the
scene and see the book slip from her fingers, and in
her dreaming sleep her hands clasp on her breast;
she raises her hand as tho she saw someone approaching.
A vision-scene pictures Prince Charming
in doublet and hose. Returning to the scene
again we find Annie wakened, with her hand over
her eyes as tho what she saw was too brilliant to
look upon.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The photoplay is silent only technically. In
order that convincing illusion be accomplished,
there must be a successful registration of all
such sounds as affect the characters and action
in the normal and natural development
of the play. We are interested only in such
sounds as have a direct bearing on the matter
that holds the attention of the audience. In
other words, it must—like all other interpretive
matter—be <i>contributory</i>.</p>

<p>In indicating that the character hears a particular
sound, we say that he “registers” it.
The term register has been used too generally
in photoplay construction to indicate what
actors shall do under the stress of every
emotion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 29.</i>) <i>For instance, “Annie registers
anger,” or “hate,” “that she will not consent to
something,” “that she is displeased.” A character
who registers anything taking place in his own
heart or soul becomes merely an actor—he is pretending.
Characters do not pretend—they ARE. They
do not register their feelings—they FEEL them
with results unquestionably natural.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Sounds are recorded then thru reflex action,
or registration, just as they actually reflect
against the drums of the ear, telling the
hearer that vibrations have been produced affecting
the ear. Sounds are visualized by
showing the appropriate affect on the character
or characters.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 30.</i>) <i>We might have a deaf old
father and his daughter. Her forbidden lover is
behind a stone wall. He whispers softly several
times before she is conscious of his call. She turns,
joyously, and the two pantomime behind the old
man’s back.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Sounds are even more effectively visualized
thru the employment of one or more correlative
scenes.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 31.</i>) <i>In one case we see someone in
the act of calling; in the next we see the call registered.
The intervening distance may be gauged by
the amount of energy expended by the character.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
Or we may see a man escaping from peril, he stumbles
and falls. The next scene shows the captors
registering the noise of his fall.</i></p>
</div>

<p>In the elemental days of the cinematograph,
it seemed improbable that music could ever
be effectively registered. The visualization of
strains of music, however, has met with most
successful accomplishment. It is effected thru
a careful imitation of the auricular and mental
process of recording sound, combined with the
use of symbols of emotion.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(EXAMPLE 32.) <i>“The Lost Melody” (Vitagraph)
is a play the plot of which is based on visualized
sound. A strain of music sung and heard by a man
under most virtuous circumstances is repeated when
he is on the point of committing a crime, and it
saves his soul.... In one scene we see the four
leading characters walking along and singing each
his love song, with his soul in his face; next we
see the dancers at the club pausing and listening,
some of the rapture of the singers faintly transmitted
to their faces; in the roadway an automobile
party stops, they put their hands behind their ears
and listen, two keeping time, the other two put the
spirit of the song in action and steal a lover’s kiss.</i></p>

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 33.</i>) <i>Five years later the song is
sung to save Douglas. The mental process of receptivity
is imitated. We see Malcolm on the terrace
singing; a close-view is then screened of a line<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
of the music and words; then we see Douglas pausing
in his act of robbing his best friend, registering
in alarm; then what he suddenly sees in his mind
and heart is visioned, being the scene of that wonderful
night years ago.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Thus the silent drama may become vibrant
with emotional music and resonant with
tongues that need no interpreter, for all nations
understand the universal language of the
heart. The most sublime characters and valiant
deeds, ravishing color and mellifluous
voices, are in our soul; sublime sympathy is
in our world-old heart; profound understanding
is in our God-given reason, and this multi-glorious
human marvel is gratified to the utmost
in having its humanity called into active
being.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>F we will view characters and characterization
as elements of interpretive and contributory
matter, along with inserts, setting and
action, it should aid us in building perfect
climaxes. This view would protect us from
that error resulting from the leading characters
seizing the bit in their teeth, so to speak, and
running amuck with the story. Characters are
subservient to climax. We have no use for
any manifestations of their character outside
of the needs of properly developing the big<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
moment of the story. Character is the most
effective means to our photoplay end.</p>

<p>Photoplay actors in particular should become
exquisite interpreters of character. Directors
should be skillful managers and directors
of interpretation and other mechanical
detail. The photoplaywright alone should be
the originator and creator of ideas and an expert
in their expression. But, because photoplaywriting
has been in a crude elemental
state, and the new mimetic art of photoplayacting
has had to be slowly and thoughtfully
developed, abuses have crept in. Too often
the director becomes the self-appointed creator,
interpreter and adapter, withholding
complete knowledge of the play from the
actors and remaking the author’s artistic ideas
according to the mold of his own mental and
emotional understanding, and the mechanical
and material equipment he has at his command,
or deems essential. Still, we cannot
too harshly blame the officious director until
the photoplaywright has become an indubitable
master of expressive and comprehensive
“business.”</p>

<p>Photodrama differs radically from the short<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
story, in that there are at least two leading
characters, instead of a single predominating,
all-absorbing character. Such a character
would be capable of little else than the development
of itself thru introspection, reminiscence
and possibly ambition, which would result
in a character study. A character study is
next to impossible in photodrama. An internal
struggle of one being with himself can sustain
but a few scenes at most. There must be two,
or more, souls (and bodies) struggling to accomplish,
overthrow or maintain a certain end.</p>

<p>We find in the photoplay, then, two leads,
or leading characters, at least; while there
may be often three or four. All the important
action surrounds these characters. We see
the characters in their characterizations standing
out clearly as symbols of the motives and
forces in the play. The hero and the heroine
battle for, and accomplish, the gratifying conclusion;
the villain and his accomplices employ
their villainous designs in an unprincipled effort
to overthrow the good, wholesome and
happy elements. Obstacles thrown in the
path of one side constitute suspense, and in
their removal form a situation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>After the leads, there may be an economical
number of supernumeraries to carry the action
along with logical environment and natural
life-likeness.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 34.</i>) <i>A courtroom, a busy street,
the floor of the stock exchange, or any other setting
wherein other characters should appear to naturalize
it, must be appropriately peopled. These characters
are animated portions of setting and contribute to
harmony.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The early identity, or differentiation between
the leads themselves, and between the
minor characters is of vast moment and importance.
The moment a character appears,
or is discovered in a scene, his identity must
be disclosed, and his relationship to the other
characters and the action made known.</p>

<p>There are three ways of establishing identity:
(a) thru personality, which discloses
strength or weakness of character and the
manner in which it dominates or is subservient
to others with whom it comes in contact; (b)
by means of idiosyncrasies, or marked personal
oddities, deformities, or deportment;
(c) vocational garb, national characteristics,
uniform or peculiarity of personal ensemble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 35.</i>) (<i>a</i>) <i>The line, “Mother weeping
and Annie supporting her,” in Scene 1 of “The
Coming of the Real Prince,” foretells a certain
strength and weakness that manifests itself thru the
two characters.</i> (<i>b</i>) <i>A character exhibits a continual
frown, or sniffs, or winks, or limps, or has a scar
or deformity.</i> (<i>c</i>) <i>As a soldier, policeman, a character
would wear his uniform, or a foreigner might
wear all or part of his native costume, etc.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Strong personalities flourish in the serious
drama, while the leads in comedy are usually
distinguished by peculiarities. Each human
being has his normal characteristics that differentiate
him from the rest of his fellows;
this must become well marked in photodrama,
tho not exaggerated to the point of becoming
a personal oddity. They must be clearly
brought out and maintained in a dignified
manner thruout the play. In the serious play,
character is but a means of developing a moving
<i>personality</i>, and personality is but the outward
symbol of the internal truths of the
story. Personality is motive visualized.</p>

<p>Your few words describing your characters
and indicating their actions must be suggestive
enough to enable the combined efforts
of director and actor to delineate truthfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
the personality that is part of your dramatic
vision. Nothing stands still in the photoplay;
therefore characters must be delineated in
terms of emotion—repressed or active—or described
in words of action—commonplace or
dramatic. The audience should be informed
unmistakably who and what your characters
are <i>thru what they do</i>. The motives of the
leading characters must come to the surface
at once in order to ignite the audience’s interest
with the dramatic spark. There must
be sufficient insinuation in <i>what</i> your characters
do, to reveal <i>why</i> they do it. Altho a
character, during the action of the play, may
develop from weakness to strength, yet each
bit of action has a determining character of
its own, that is either weak or strong.</p>

<p>The immediate and unmistakable identity of
your characters is essential to knowing your
characters; the early and clear establishment
of relationship between characters is essential
to grasping your story. A profound study of
the subject yields the conclusion that the
simplest, most economical, quickest and most
effective means of revealing the identity and
establishing the relationship of the character<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
is the caption. Without the caption we must
resort to the inartistically obvious and more
or less clumsy devices, such as doors labeled
“Private Office of John Smith”; trade-signs,
as “Solomon Isaacs, Pawnbroker,” or have the
actors overgesture their parts in a laborious effort
to tell the audience who and what they are.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 36.</i>) <i>A perusal of six produced
plays discloses the unanimous use of the caption for
the combined purposes of identity and relationship.
These captions usually appear early in the play—before
the second or third scene: (1) GEORGIA
WANTS TO BE A LEADER OF HER SEX AND
NOT A DRUDGE; (2) ANNIE’S WIDOWED
MOTHER LEFT PENNILESS; (3) COLONEL
FARRINGTON FORCES HIS DAUGHTER ON
MARSTON, HIS SUPPOSED BENEFACTOR;
(4) MALCOLM DECIDES TO WAIT AND
MAKE HIS PROPOSAL TO ROSALIE AN
ARTISTIC OCCASION; (5) SHELBURNE,
HARD HIT, TURNS AGAINST HIS IRRESPONSIBLE
LIFE; (6) ARCHER DURAND
AND HIS WIFE ARRIVE IN THE MINING
DISTRICT HALF STARVED.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The letter insert can be employed with
equal effectiveness. The characters once introduced
effectively, their future actions are
easily understood—providing they are logical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
and natural. The relationships, as they are
established by the first appearances of the
characters, form the premise of the plot and
the argument of the story that are readily followed,
if the scenes are well-knit and the
story interesting.</p>

<p>In conjunction with the caption or letter,
then, something occurs immediately to grasp
the attention and offer insight into characters,
their relationships and motives. Furthermore,
both vocation and character may be indicated
by environment, make-up, costume, tools, manner
and culture. Contrasts in action, appearance
and conduct between characters is always
effective in clarifying characterization. Where
there are no voices and many characters, great
care must be exercised to differentiate. The
sooner the writer realizes the difficulties that
beset actor and director in differentiating
character, the quicker he will begin to economize
on the number he employs and to
strengthen personalities. It is an axiom of
photodrama that the bigger the idea, <i>the
fewer the characters</i>! Thus it is seen that too
many important characters make too great a
demand on the audience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>In order that the character may exhibit the
motive underlying the action, the writer must
visualize it, and the actor must realize it.
There must be mimetic harmony, sympathy
and naturalness.</p>

<p>We are cautioned by some savants never to
tell the actor <i>how</i> to act a line, but tell them
only <i>what</i> to do. We disagree. Providing
the writer has become an expert in the writing
of business and dramatic expression, he can
scarcely infringe on the director’s right, the
actor’s profession, or injure the prospects of
his play by offering an analysis of the construction
of the characters he himself has
created. Co-operation is too often lacking
from the fact that the actor seldom knows
exactly what he is trying to do. The director
extricates a jumbled part from the inseparable
whole of the play, recites it extempore for the
actor and drills the requisite action into him.
How, then, can the actor be expected to interpret
things and put them in that were in
the mind of the writer? He must guess at the
harmony of the composition, surmise the relationships,
and consequently lose all the nice
touches that the true artist would incorporate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
in the well-made play. It is the actor’s sole
business and art to interpret ideas. He is the
living motive of the play and the most important
symbol in the expression of its inner
truth. When will actors learn their lines in
order to catch the very soul of your play, instead
of yah-yahing at each other when a
visualized exchange of words is necessary?
But the writer will have to write the essential
words—perhaps that’s the rub?</p>

<p>Violent action will always excite and thrill
the mind; but it takes passive repression to
move the soul. The body that suffers, writhes
and flings itself about; the hurt soul shrinks
back and lies stunned. The prick of a pin will
make a strong man jump spasmodically a foot
in the air; a sharp word will make the noblest
soul sink deep into gloom. We actors, directors
and playwrights are seeking the artistic
expression of the life of the soul; the existence
and agency of the body are merely means to
that end. We should be striving to capture
the soft lights and shadows of mental impressionism;
and not be struggling to imprison
the bold sunlight and harsh lines of physical
photography. Deep emotion and its characterization<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
lies not in the bold step forward, but in
the shrinking half-step backward; not in the
brazen eye, but in the shy, drooping eye-lid;
not in the defiant word, but in the silent, quivering
lip; not in the blow of the fist, but in
the gentle, stroking hand; not in the violent
embrace, but in the tender caress; not in the
sudden turn on the heel, but in the shrug of
the shoulders—one is a matter of physical
mechanics, the other emotional art. If emotional
art is put first in our endeavors, all
the range of physical mechanics will follow
logically, but secondarily.</p>

<p>Our writers have been frightened away
from suggestive artistic detail, and have fallen
upon the evil way of bald physical mechanics
that leave nothing to the imagination. The
gentle gesture, the poise of the head, the
trembling lip, the downcast eye, of the story
vision are usurped by the over-emphasized
action. Decisive action is essential in the
photoplay, but the producer’s version is too
often another story.</p>

<p>Characters should tend to personify and
visualize the tender twilights of pathos; the
soft shadows of pain and sorrow; the gentle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
glow of goodness and nobility; the serene surface
of happiness. They should build the lives
of the audience anew; inspire them to noble
deeds; let them touch the hem of the garment
of sublimity and teach them life’s lessons of
humility, forbearance and faith.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HAT shall we write about, and how
shall we write it?</p>

<p>Here the playwright must pause and look
his fellow men, his friends, his parents, his
children, his wife, and his conscience square
in the eye. They are one and all his intimate
audience. They will be influenced by his
product, be pleased or offended in its production,
and thru it see his heart with all its
strength and weakness laid bare.</p>

<p>Broadly, our theme shall be Life—Life in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
all its aspects: the gorgeous and the threadbare;
the noble and the sordid; the happy and
the sorrowful; the righteous and the sinful;
the healthy and the ailing; the youthful and
the aged; the strong and the weak. But it
must be the <i>life that we know</i>—not necessarily
thru experience, but possibly thru study, observation
or intuition.</p>

<p>Choice of theme is a matter requiring,
chiefly, a respectful observance of the general
popular demand and the particular needs of
the studios, unless you are genius enough to
initiate and lead the popular tastes. But the
subject of treatment is one requiring a far
more delicate exercise of judgment. Any conceivable
theme may be spoiled by an indiscreet
or injudicious viewpoint.</p>

<p>The playwright conveys powerful personalities
to his characters, but remains passively
impersonal himself. He immovably records
truth, never interposing himself, his opinions
or his bias. His characters pursue their own
lives; they are neither automatons nor marionettes;
they live according to their individual
natures and have provokingly free wills.</p>

<p>The photoplaywright has but to remain on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
the side of right and justice, good citizenship
and decency. He communicates nothing thru
the symbols of his play that he would hesitate,
refrain or be ashamed of telling those nearest,
dearest and most sacred to him. Public audiences
are daily made up of millions of people,
who are highly impressionable, of tender age
and of simple susceptibilities. Providing our
play is effective, it contains a very positive
influence, that means either a rise or a fall in
moral values in every community wherein it
is exhibited. The playwright must be the figure
of justice that shows no mercy to the
wrongdoer; the sword of retribution he
carries in one hand, in the other he holds the
scales of just rewards. There simply must be
a moral ending.</p>

<p>It is more essential that the villain be vanquished,
than punished. Our story is not
vengeance, but is usually concerned with the
victory of the good element—or hero—and
the incidental adventures of circumventing the
villain and misfortune. Stories in which the
good element is overcome by the bad, thus
placing a premium on the bad, are unmoral.
Stories or plays showing the delights to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
gained from illicit pleasures or pursuits, followed
or not by adequate punishment or retribution,
are immoral.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 37.</i>) <i>Thus the so-called “white slave,”
“drug terror” and underworld plays, reeking with depravity,
leering with lasciviousness and groveling in
intemperance, are actually immoral. Their symbols
of vice are all-powerful, and any symbols of virtue
introduced are usually wishy-washy in comparison.
The hero or heroine is usually a weak character, instead
of a strong one. We see vice exercising a baneful
influence, robbing its victim of will, health and
life. Vice conquers. We do not need “examples” of
what not to do. We should be inspired by the nobility
of good, and not cowed by the fear of evil.
The countless throngs that crowd the exhibition of
these so-called plays for the most part are craning
to get a view of gleaming flesh quivering in pools of
forbidden passion, rather than seeking a glimpse of a
tortured soul—neither one being an edifying entertainment.</i></p>
</div>

<p>At first thought, it would seem as tho crime
were the most frequent factor among the
sources of dramatic construction. As a matter
of fact, accomplished crime does figure powerfully
in more than two-thirds of all dramatic
productions, including the highest class. Active
vice, the venial and deadly sins and potential<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
crime occur even more frequently thruout
the course of our dramatic development. It
would seem as tho we should have no little
difficulty in making our good characters walk
the straight and narrow path among such a
network of pitfalls.</p>

<p>But even the writer of the most moral plays
should glory in the omnipresence of sin and
crime, tho never glorify it. Good would be
colorless as dramatic material, were it not for
evil. Evil is the foil for goodness; it is the
contrast that delivers goodness from monotony;
evil is the shadow that gives the highlight
of goodness its chiaroscuro; it is the salt
that saves it from saccharinity. When evil,
misfortune, or bereavement oppose us, they
oftentime bring to the surface and develop
our otherwise hidden virtues, making them
illuminate the lives of others and add a ray
of undying nobility to the world’s fiction experience.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 38.</i>) <i>Five produced plays selected at
random reveal the following facts in relation to the
employment of crime: (1) THE COMING OF THE
REAL PRINCE—An immoral, flashy man of the
city attempts to seduce an innocent, visionary country
girl. He is thwarted by the rousing of dead mother-love<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
and of a sublime nobility in a country yokel; (2)
THE LOST MELODY—The memory of his sweet,
innocent dead wife, brought back to him thru hearing
a forgotten melody, stays a man’s hand from robbing
his best friend; (3) UNTO THE CHILDREN—A
boy inherits the vice of gambling from his father,
but it is burnt forever out of his nature, by the sublime
heroism and sacrifice of his mother at the critical
moment; (4) THE STRUGGLE—The brutal assault
of strikers on a strike-breaker, brings the capitalist
and laborers face to face on a common plane of pity
and nobility; (5) BRANDED FOR LIFE—An ex-convict,
striving in vain for reinstatement in the
eyes of society, is enabled thru a noble and inspiring
sacrifice to win the respect of all men.</i></p>
</div>

<p>A play will exert influence in the same proportion
as it is artistically effective; which is
as much as to say, the greater the artist the
greater his power for good or evil. To become
over-zealous in presenting morality leads to
propaganda; to be too realistic and careless
in the portrayal of immorality leads into the
mire of obscenity. True art has nothing to
do with morality, for or against; it is
intrinsically noble, uplifting and inspiring.
Whether the life of the artist is exemplary
or not is a matter of his own conscience; the
life of his character creations must keep within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
the bounds of decency, be amenable to the
laws of the country and subject to the rewards
and punishments gratifying to the best impulses
of the wholesome minded.</p>

<p>Tragedy is an exception, in that we often
see a good character overwhelmed by circumstances,
environment and nature. But tragedy
should conform to inspiration, in that we behold
the doomed character revealing unguessed
sublimity in the unequal struggle.</p>

<p>Together with this question of treatment
comes that of, “How real do we want our realism?”
It is answered indirectly by saying that
just so much of any of life’s experiences as we
may disclose or relate in promiscuous company,
in the presence of innocent—not necessarily
puritanic—understandings and quick
perceptions, may be delineated on the screen.
Each age has its own broadnesses and limitations
in this respect, of which every refined
and intelligent person is cognizant. Drama is
not dependent upon frank discussions of revolting
or lascivious subjects; entertainment
is its prime function. A searching analysis of
either vice or virtue is contrary to the principles
of dramatic action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>The actual commission of crime is not as
important as the cause and effect of it.
Morbid curiosity is the only excuse for the
sight of a deed of murder, suicide, or other
vicious crime. <i>How</i> a crime is committed is
an element of criminology, not drama.</p>

<p>We have to thank the National Board of
Censorship for the exclusion of actual deeds
of crime. This censoring body, unfortunately,
has been composed almost wholly of persons
who are theoretically the very antipodes of
crime and naturally intolerant to its employment
at all. Time may bring us a less biased
exercise and a broader view of their powers.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 39.</i>) <i>Criminal deeds are easily and
effectively handled in photoplay. For instance, murder—we
see the culprit and the victim in separate
scenes: a man at his desk in one scene; the murderer
breaking into the office, in another. Another scene
brings us to the instant BEFORE the deed—the
weapon poised, or culprit and victim in mortal combat.
We may here interpose a scene of someone
registering a pistol shot, or hearing the scuffle. In
another scene we return to the crime and find it has
just been committed. Any crime may be effectively
delineated in this manner.</i></p>
</div>

<p>In the matter of casting characters, no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
character can properly be cast a villain unless
his actions comprehend a conscious knowledge
of guilt. Our hero oftentimes commits a crime
or misdemeanor unwittingly, or in that stage
of his character development before the elements
of the story itself change him from
weak to strong. The thoroly bad character
must remain bad, just as he would in life; the
good character may be bad temporarily and
become bettered, but we must make him suffer
from his misdeeds. In other words, our characters
become <i>living people</i> who are endowed
with human traits of which their every action
is the natural outcome.</p>

<p>Good taste in the selection and treatment of
theme brings us back again to the same admonition
of exercising the simple quality of
being well-bred. Just as we would not think
of startling a drawing-room assembly by forcing
our personal bias upon it, so we must
select our dramatic matter in a serious, humane
and delicate manner. There are potent
commercial reasons, as well as the dogma of
good taste, for not caricaturing races, ridiculing
creeds, satirizing politics and making fun
of physical deformities and mental infirmities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>Occasion, occupation and environment each
has it own propriety and convention that must
carefully be observed by the photoplaywright.
This is not a matter of delicacy so much as
it is one of producing conviction thru
naturalness.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 40.</i>) <i>The seashore is an occasion for
women wearing extremely abbreviated costumes that
would be improper in the street; the occupation of
the doctor is one that permits women to enter his
quarters alone with propriety; the environment of the
Orient makes it a convention for women to smoke and
guests to sit on the floor.</i></p>
</div>

<p>In summing up this most important phase
of the photodrama, we may say briefly: Let
your sympathies ever be found with the purest,
best and noblest there is in life; make your
story show your condemnation of the low and
evil. But don’t be a prude or a preacher! Do
not permit yourself to be accused of trying to
teach better things, but let your work <i>inspire</i>
them!</p>

PRINCIPLE.</p>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N no literary effort is technique more important
or essential than in the construction
of the photoplay. There are arbitrary
rules that must be followed and conventions
that cannot be ignored. We must
cater to the manufacturer’s possibilities;
we must conform to fixed mechanical limitations;
we interpret our art thru “business”;
we must gather the world-wide
vision within the narrow focus of the
camera’s eye. Our play-form and technique<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
must be sufficiently potent, suggestive and
revealing to enable competent co-operators to
discern, interpret and manufacture an effective
concrete and vividly <i>alive</i> reproduction of
our abstract vision, so that it may be readily
recognized and emotionally realized by independent
audiences the world over.</p>

<p>The photoplaywright is the only literary
craftsman who does not carve, model and perfect
with his own handiwork the actual presentment
of his creation offered to the public.
And, greatest obstacle of all—our photoplaywright
must accomplish his eloquent task by
remaining technically silent! We come to the
inevitable conclusion that construction and
technique are equal in importance—if not superior—to
idea or conception of the writer.</p>

<p>The matter of bare photoplay form is but
the slightest move in the direction of perfect
effect. It is the subject of <i>effective</i> photoplay
form and how to produce the effects that
really count.</p>

<p>We may set down as one of the first principles
of photodrama, that the playwright must
make his rule of construction: People go to
the theater to <i>see</i> a deed and not to read or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
hear <i>about</i> it. There are several ways of construing
a breach of this principle. The first
is that of telling the story indirectly by means
of captions and inserts, instead of directly
thru consecutive action. This is the method
of the poor plotter and shallow artificer who
sticks in a caption or insert whenever he encounters
an obstacle, oftentimes skipping the
climacteric situations and showing the trifling
details.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 41.</i>) <i>AFTER THE RIOT JOE
KEPT IN BED WITH BROKEN ARM .... Audiences
simply will not accept that broken arm as convincing
unless their reasons can vouch for the violence
that led to it. But riots are more easily skipped than
successfully delineated. All climacteric scenes must
be shown and not merely referred to. We always
take the commonplace for granted; but never the
extraordinary.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Next we deal with an offending heritage
from short story fiction, the story within a
story or, as we shall here call it, a story within
a play. It should never be resorted to; it need
never be done. It breaks the thread of one
story to insert another that in nearly every
case is stronger than the original, forming
an anti-climax instead of contributing to one.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
Its use means that the play has not been carefully
plotted, that it has not been begun early
enough, or in the right place, and that it is
trying laboriously to explain something that
would not stand by itself.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 42.</i>) <i>In the Vitagraph’s “A Million
Bid,” the quasi-hero is picked up again after having
been absent for more than a reel, and sets in to tell
what has happened to him while he has been away!
Most of it was entirely “another story,” but much
of it might have been effectually interwoven with
the progressing action of the play. As it was, it
was most difficult to grasp the fact that we had been
hauled months back in point of time. In the mental
melée we lost sight of the main theme altogether,
and most of us never quite got back to it. All of us
were befuddled to some extent. It was intended, no
doubt, that the audience should not know the identity
of the narrator until the heroine herself found it out,
which would have made it worse in thus having an
entire stranger break into our story and consume
nearly one-third of the entire play!</i></p>
</div>

<p>The most common form of a story within
a play is the one in which the hunter, or the
veteran, or the old person blighted in love, or
some such character sits down, with a younger
person usually, and in the end there is a
laborious effort to make the experience of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
older person play a part in the younger’s
career. There may be exceptions to a hard-and-fast
rule of avoiding these devices, but
usually it will be found that there is a remedy
in the principles of the photodrama itself that
say begin your action back at <i>the very beginning</i>
and <i>always go forward.</i></p>

<p>The third pitfall, is that of trying to record
speeches—dramatic tho they be—by supposedly
visualizing what the speaker is referring
to; of trying to tell the story of a
crime, for instance, thru the trial of the culprit,
rather than by showing the events preceding
and causing the trial in their chronological
order. Here, as in the former instance,
the vision is resorted to. The vision is apt to
be employed in dramatizing the detective story
that is primed with a surprise in the climax in
which the method of its revealment is disclosed
by going back and showing the steps.
Let it be a rare exception that makes you ever
turn backward; for neither time nor drama
can do it without violating a natural law.</p>

<p>To be explicit, the photoplay is a <i>now</i> play!
The now may be a thousand years ago, but
it must be relived again, now. All of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
should warn us to avoid long lapses of time,
occurring especially in the one-part play.</p>

<p>Nothing quite emphasizes the “now” quality
of the photodrama as the invariable practice
of employing nothing but the <i>present tense</i> in
writing the photoplay. Synopsis and scenario
are seemingly conscious of the things they are
engaged in doing now. Past deeds and future
prophecies—employing their respective tenses—frequently
occur in captions and inserts,
however.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 43.</i>) <i>From a letter: “I have never
seen you take any interest in anything.” Caption:
“In fifty minutes your child will be on the scrap heap,
too!”</i></p>
</div>

<p>The laws of natural movement and action
should never be violated by the characters
themselves. Any character who is to appear
in the next scene must always be seen to
<i>leave</i> the present scene, disappearing from
view in that action, and again be seen to <i>come
on</i> the scene that follows. It is unnecessary to
accompany the character thru the various and
uninteresting steps between his leaving one
scene and arrival on the next. If something
dramatic happens to him en route then we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
should see it. Contrary to fiction construction,
scene precedes character in presentation. We
are carried to the new scene and meet the
character at the door as it were, and the illusion
is complete. A preliminary fragment of
action transpiring in the following scene, before
the appearance of the character, will lend
a further contribution to naturalness.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 44.</i>) <i>In scene 27, of “All Power for
a Day,” we find Alice hurriedly leaving the crowd
when she has seen the face of the man she hates. In
scene 28, the room, in her boarding-house is shown,
her landlady—her enemy’s confederate—snooping for
a bit among her things before she enters.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Characters must not be left in one scene
and be discovered in the next following. They
are not clothing dummies or marionettes, to
be picked up bodily and helplessly and placed
in set poses for the inspection of the audience.
If another scene intervenes in which the same
character does not appear, then it is not necessary
for him to “come and go,” since we presume
he has had time and freedom for the
necessary action while we were engaged with
the alternate scene.</p>

<p>The scene principle in the photoplay is one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
of reflective power. One scene reacts, rebounds,
reflects, reverberates from the scene
that precedes it to the scene that follows it;
all bear a cumulative relation toward the
climax.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 45.</i>) <i>In “The Master of the Lost
Hills” we have six scenes all different, yet showing
the reflective power with tremendous force: (1)
Mary aims gun out of window and tells brother to
step back or she will shoot; (2) Brother hesitates in
his advance; (3) Close-view of Mary taking aim;
(4) Just at edge of woods Mary’s desperate lover is
taking aim at her; (5) Portion of dense forest showing
sheriff and posse, who have come to rescue Mary,
lost; (6) Exterior of shack shows mob drawing closer.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Another scene principle that we have
learned is that every time the camera is shifted
an iota we have a new scene. Theoretically,
the eye of the camera never moves, excepting
in the disillusioning practice of some operators
to follow the movements of energetic characters
by “panoram-ing.”</p>

<p>Our rule for length, duration and number
of scenes is governed by the unalterable unit
of the reel, or 1,000 feet of film. A short play—one
reel—may consist of from 25 to 50
scenes; according to the directness, tone,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
treatment by the author and the method of
the director. The exciting play of comedy,
adventure and peril moves along rapidly, with
short, quick scenes and many “returns,” just
as in fiction we use short sentences and employ
words and phraseology that remind us of and
constantly revert to the hero’s imminent peril.
The duration of a scene is in direct ratio to
the vital relationship of its action to the
climax.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 46.</i>) <i>In “The Salt of Vengeance” the
grief-crazed father of an injured child sets a bomb
under the rails that will blow to atoms the child of
the man who is responsible for the injury. The
lunatic pens up the guilty man, taunts him with the
swiftly approaching fate of his precious child. This
scene endures for several minutes. The next is a
mere “flash” of a speeding railroad train occupying
several seconds.</i></p>
</div>

<p>It is a natural law of drama that demands
the establishment of identity almost the moment
that a character appears. This is especially
requisite in photodrama because of the
rapid panorama of scenes that hurry on and
off, at the rate of 75 to 200 an hour. One
moment’s doubt on the part of the audience—so
incredibly swift and fleeting is the hurry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
of photoplay events—may mean the misunderstanding
or losing of a year of the hero’s life.</p>

<p>Learn and follow rules always with a willing
mind; but never let them lead you around
by the nose. The man who cannot take a
single step without consulting his rules will
become a wooden worker. “The way to make
rules really valuable is to thoroly learn them,
then literally forget them by perfectly practicing
them.” Now and then we see something
in a play that is superior to rules and
technique; something that would have been
cramped and crushed by rules. At present
the photodrama has many superficial rules
and a technique that is often archaic and lacks
the element of futurity.</p>

<p>All said and done, we are not teaching
technique, or laying down rules; rather, we are
trying to interpret the laws of human conduct,
the science of being natural and the art of
entertaining effectively.</p>

photoplay inception and construction have

facilitating its manufacture. It is about time
that we took the profit-yielding audiences
into consideration by supplying the artistic
entertainment for which they are crying.
The manufacturing end is well able to take
care of itself; the actor has demonstrated
in a vast number of instances that he is able
“to deliver the goods”—if he is supplied with
them; a large number of directors have
demonstrated remarkable ability in assembling
and directing the material elements that perfectly
interpret and visualize the story of the
playwright. <i>All that is needed is the trained

general is world-wide. Because of the brevity
of the plays, the cheapness of admission to
the theaters, and the quick and universal appeal
to the emotions our first and most numerous
patrons are the lower classes and especially
the children. For these reasons alone,
suggestiveness, the portrayal of crime in such
a way as to show how it is done, or as to
inspire its commission, are not to be exploited.
Taking sides with either the masses or the
classes; with labor or capital, or with the
white race versus races of color, is not only inartistic
but dangerously incendiary. Politics
are too local as play material, as we must
always bear in mind that our play is to appear
in Timbuctoo as well as in Tonopah. Religion
is too delicate, too cherished and too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
sacred a subject for anything but dignified
and unprejudiced treatment. Films that <i>in
any way reflect</i> upon the Roman Catholic
Church will be barred out of many Catholic
countries. The European market is a most
profitable source of income to many American
manufacturers. In this connection we have
but to remember that the human heart has the
same strength and struggle, the same weaknesses
and tragedies the world over. Difference
of language, however, raises a few minor
pitfalls. For example, placards of warning,
ransom, rewards and other matter which play
a part in the story thru the audience’s reading
it in the picture, should be eliminated. These
points are easily circumscribed—and made
more effective—by the use of the insert. Just
as captions have to be made in the language
of each exhibiting country, so do the proper
inserts.</p>

<p>2. <span class="large">MANUFACTURER</span>. (a) <i>Editor</i>—Some
reader will have to pass on your manuscript,
in all likelihood, before the editor sees
it. In both cases, the Synopsis becomes the
gate of approval. They do not read the
Scenario at all unless the Synopsis is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
eminently promising. An editor wants what he
needs, rather than what he personally desires
to see presented. Your manuscript might
contain the most pleasing and producible play
in the world, yet if it did not fit his existing
needs it would be poor policy to purchase it.
Your manuscript is its own appeal and needs
no personal letter; it is advisable not to write
one. Your title is surely going to influence the
editor strongly for or against further perusal
of the manuscript. The editor will naturally
be partial to the short Synopsis, but do not
coddle this partiality by making your Synopsis
too bald. The editor does not accept a manuscript,
as a rule, until he has held a conference
over it—possibly with the managing-director
of the company adapted to producing the type
of story in question. A careful observance of
the rule of economy—economy of supers and
principals, of <i>interior sets</i>, of props, of difficult
scenes, of energy, time and expense—is
bound to be appreciated.</p>

<p>(b) <i>Studio</i>—In the term studio, we may
include director, actor, stage carpenter, and
interior lightings and effects. No one is more
pleased with a simple and powerful story than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
the director, and frequently no one has quite
as much to say about the acceptance of the
manuscript as this same highest-paid employee.
It has often happened that even a bought manuscript
of undoubted merit has never seen the
light of the screen because there have been
several difficult scenes to master, either mechanically
or emotionally. The manuscript
must be concise and quick in showing the
director how many sets must be constructed
or got out, how many actors must be employed,
what props and costumes must be
bought, rented or ordered. It is in this relation,
that a scene plot may be used to
advantage, for it will enable the director to
consider the matter of suitable locations for
exteriors. Unless he has child actors available,
the matter of juvenile leads may mean the rejection
of an otherwise desirable play.
Military, costume or period plays are sure
to be frowned down unless it is the producing
policy of the manufacturer to put them on.
Unless the producer has at his command
trained animals, either wild or tame, it will
be a waste of postage to send him plays the
scenes or situations of which depend upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
animal acting. Several manufacturers maintain
menageries! Each studio has a star or
two of either sex who is best known for certain
types of characters and plays. These high
salaried artists must be kept busy. Study their
needs!</p>

<p>(c) <i>Photography</i>—Such photographic marvels
have been accomplished in motography,
that the playwright is apt to forget that there
is any boundary line to possibility in photographic
effects. First of all, there is the matter
of color; blue, for instance, becomes white
on the screen, and red, black. Black and white
alone are resultant except in kinemacolor or
in tinted negative. When a situation or dramatic
point depends upon color, it will have to
be indicated either by caption or by insert.
The camera is quicker than the human eye and
more unfailing, in that it records everything
that passes within its range of focus. Tyros
have to be told again and again that exteriors
cannot be made at night. The night scene
would have to be artificially lighted by a flash,
which would result in a daylight effect! Rain,
night, lightning, storm and pictures taken in
a darkened or over-lighted atmosphere, are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
usually “effects” artificially created. We do
not see, for instance, bona fide lightning descending
from the sky and simultaneously
striking a man dead. The technical secret of
portraying all difficult effects of this kind is by
showing them in two or more scenes—<i>first
cause, then effect</i>. First, we see lightning in
the sky; then, we see the man the instant
after being struck, collapsing. Night exteriors
may be well simulated by having the action
isolated under the rays of a street lamp
or other direct rays of light, with darkness
surrounding. Light and the want of it are
the chief obstacles in the way of photography;
the genius of the directors and their co-operators
have made almost any conceivable “effect”
possible. Frequently manuscripts call for exteriors
in foreign countries. Very seldom can
backgrounds and sets do anything more than
make a cheap, wooden presentment of the
Eiffel Tower, or the Pyramids or St. Paul’s,
London. The playwright may accomplish his
aim, by keeping his foreign scenes all interiors,
with possibly a glimpse of the distant landmark
thru the window.</p>

<p>(d) <i>Manufacturer</i>—Every manufacturing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
company has some producing policy or characteristic.
The Kalem, for instance, is noteworthy
for its war dramas, Edison for its
leaning toward topical themes—and so on. In
this relation, it may be well to remember that
each company has a staff of salaried playwrights
who furnish many of their typical features.
The manufacturers both love and hate
the spectacular; they feel that it is beloved
by the public and the life of competition, yet
they abhor the dangers, destructivity and
tremendous expense and superhuman effort it
entails. Some day they will realize that the
public really loves simple drama more than
they do sensational spectacle.</p>


<p>3. <span class="large">THE MANUSCRIPT</span> (a) <i>Technique</i>—In
fiction the deeds need only be probable;
in photodrama they must be actually performable,
because the audience must see them. For
the photoplay must show whatever is vital.
Keep your captions down to 15 words at the
most, and your inserts to 20, as every word
means a foot of film. Tell how your characters
shall act, leave to the director where
and how they enter and exit. Write mainly
about characters that arouse the spectators’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
sympathy. Our photoplay is not told, but
acted. Photoplay happenings should transpire
in the same order as they do in life. There
is nothing so unconvincing as a multiplicity
of coincidences. First become an expert on
words, if you would be a master of thought.
Be certain that you state briefly all crises,
situations, and the climax in the Synopsis.
Be sure that you feel all the emotions you plan
to inspire in others and that you have a dramatic
idea before you worry about technique.</p>

<p>(b) <i>Preparation</i>—Good English is essential
to the photoplaywright, not merely because it
is the badge of literacy, but because thru good,
clear, forceful English alone can the playwright
hope to give searching expression to
an exquisite impression! Beside being a literary
offering, the submission of a manuscript
is a purely business venture. We offer our
goods for sale; we put them up in an attractively
neat parcel; we label them plainly with
our name and address in the left-hand corner
of the Cast, Synopsis and Scenario sheets
only; we prepay the postage of the manuscript
both to and from the prospective buyer,
sustaining a good impression by inclosing a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
self-addressed envelope. A carbon copy of
a manuscript is the only perfect safeguard in
case of loss. The hand-written manuscript is
as out-of-date as the hand printing press.</p>

<p>(c) <i>Sale</i>—You can not force a firm to buy
what it does not want, and it is unbusinesslike
to demand reasons or to censure it for its
refusal to do so. You will be paid, naturally,
what the manuscript is commercially worth
and not what it may be valued at by you. You
should always be conceded the privilege of
refusing an offer, just as the buyer is given
the right to buy. A photoplay cannot be
copyrighted, thanks to a ludicrous Department
of the United States Government. Happily,
published works of Literature can—after a
fashion—so that the aspiring playwright will
do best to photodramatize only such plays,
books, short stories and poems as he himself
is author of. If you wish to reserve story or
stage rights, make it clear in the receipt you
sign. The photoplay market has a unique bit
of etiquette—for a business transaction—that
demands of you to submit your manuscript to
but one manufacturer at a time. Sales are influenced,
of course, by the excellence of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
playwright’s product; but they are forced alone
by the law of supply and demand.</p>

<p>A few important admonitions remain, chief
among which is to eschew the sterile pseudonym
of “moving pictures,” when photodrama
is meant. Furthermore, scorn and cry
down the derogatory and ignominious term of
“movie” that stands between the playwright
and his claim to a dignified profession.</p>

<p><i>Be original</i>—and you can only acquire the
virtue thru a constant attendance at the theaters,
seeking what has been worn to triteness
and learning what has never been done at all.
Observe what “gets the hand,” and you will
surely find what will get the heart! Be persistent—if
you have faith in your play; keep
revising it; keep sending it out.</p>

<p>THE PLOT GERM; THE PREMISE ADVANCED;
ANCIENT THEME AND ORIGINAL TREATMENT.</p></div>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>O the producer a plot is material capable
of being dramatized thru visualized
action into a life-like story. To the playwright
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>a plot is suggestive material capable
of being developed into the nucleus of a
story.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[A]</a> “The Plot of the Short Story—an Exhaustive Study,
Both Synthetical and Analytical, with Copious Examples,
Making the Work a Practical Treatise,” is recommended to
students desiring to study this important subject exhaustively.</p>

</div>

<p>The average plot builder makes the mistake
of looking upon plot material as ready-made
plots. He thus confuses plot germ (or
material) with complete plot. Plot germs lie
about us by the score; complete plots are hidden
in the most evasive creases of our imaginative
genius. The plot germ is merely an item
of suggestive plot material, which may be lost
sight of entirely in the search for the logical
incidents to complete the plot that is eventually
led up to. Plot germs, then, are ready-made;
but complete plots are made-to-order.</p>

<p>The source, manifestation and aim of all
plots is Man (or humanity), his desires
(or passions) and his emotional relationships
with his God and his fellow-man. A plot
germ is an isolated incident, phase, deed, relationship,
fragment, or moment, vitally connected
with and suggestive of man’s emotional
life. A plot germ is seldom used exactly in
the form in which it originally presents itself.
It is valuable principally as <i>suggestive</i> material.
Like other germs, it must be pregnant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
with a life of its own that will vitally affect
any other mass upon which its energies are
concentrated. Carrying the simile further, we
find that plot germs, too, often so change
the nature of the ideas they fasten upon, that
they lose their own identity in the master idea.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 47.</i>) <i>Man’s relations with the Devil
is in itself plot material, but too general. We must
become more particular. Crime is one of man’s relationships
with the Devil, but that is not available
as definite plot material; at least it is not a plot
germ as yet. We further particularize, and select
sub-divisions of crime: Bomb, Thief and Finger
prints. Here again is elemental plot material, but
there are further steps still to be taken before we
can class them as legitimate plot material, or plot
germs. At last, we arrive upon pregnant material—among
the items of the daily newspaper—which we
can seize upon as plot germs: “Bomb Throwers
Trailed by a Boy;” “Caretaker Locked in Closet by a
Thief;” and “Take Finger Prints of Everybody.”</i></p>
</div>

<p>The discovery of a plot germ, however,
merely marks the beginning of the exercise of
one’s plotting power. This starts our thoughts
in a definite train in search of an idea. The
idea proves to be something <i>big</i> that comes
to pass; that is our story. Now we will begin
to build our plot by seeking a <i>cause</i> for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
the great deed that culminates the story. That
cause becomes the beginning of our play. The
effect of the causal condition, ambition or
deed, results in the events that happen between
the beginning and climax of the play, and
raises three standard questions that our complete
plot must answer: (1) What is the
Cause? (2) What is the Effect of the cause?
(3) What Climax does the effect lead to?</p>

<p>A great photoplay plot should concern a
ludicrous, a pathetic, an heroic or a tragic
episode in the lives of two or more people. A
complete plot is, in fact, a perfect syllogism.
We advance our first premise for the action to
follow in the Cause; our second premise is the
Effect, or action; there can be but one conclusion,
which we demonstrate in the Climax.</p>

<p>Original themes are few in number and
were all used scores and scores of times before
this generation was born; original plots
are inexhaustible and admit of as many variations
as there are products in literature from
different minds based upon the original twenty-six
letters of the alphabet. Do not be afraid
of the ancient theme, because the fact that it
still survives shows its popular sway; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
your survival as a playwright depends on your
originality in treatment of plot material in its
application to theme.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">D</span>AILY life is filled with dull routine and
monotonous detail; but drama is contrary
to actual life, in that it picks and chooses
the events it requires for its purposes, isolating,
magnifying and suppressing them according
to its needs. Drama demands that
there be a keynote of human interest, a bond
of vital relationship, in the life of man, or the
revealment of a soul’s supreme moment under
pressure of struggle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>To have one’s eyes open in his search for
plot material is not sufficient; the plot seeker’s
imagination must be sensitively alert, and his
emotions prepared to throw some feeling into
the impression. Thus equipped, he may acquire
<i>visions</i> thru observation, and not mere
mental photographs. Bear in mind that this
matter of creating Literature and Drama
draws just as heavily on the emotions as it
does on brains. The imagination is the
frontier post between the two.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 48.</i>) <i>A plot germ resulting from observation:
A man sits in his office looking out of the
window when a blinding flash assails his eyes. It
proves to be a boy passing the window opposite with
a bright can in his hand which refracted the sun. A
plot germ instantly suggests itself: He visions an
old house, set back from the road; surrounded by
shrubbery; he is the hero who sits in his own home
some distance away; the flash; he gets his glasses
and sees a woman in distress—there is productive
material for a play. Scarcely a vestige of the original
suggestive matter remains.</i></p>
</div>

<p>It is more beneficial for a student of literature
or drama to associate with the works of
a master than with the master himself. Few
successful artists are successful teachers; their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
success lies in their having absorbed and <i>forgotten</i>
technique. Thus in hearing and seeing
drama and reading literature, the promising
student should normally feel all that is
noble and great within him rise—like a host
on the wings of inspiration—to meet and do
honor to the master creatures of thought and
feeling created by the playwright and author.
Exaltation is the coveted gateway to inspiration,
thru which every artist-creator must
pass.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 49.</i>) <i>A visit to the drama might yield
a plot germ in the following manner: Let us say we
saw Douglas Fairbank’s noteworthy impersonation of
Bertie in “The New Henrietta.” We were inspired
at once with a story surrounding “The Boy Who
Couldn’t Be Bad”—which is the title and theme of
our incipient play.</i></p>
</div>

<p>In employing facts to any large degree, the
photoplaywright will encounter danger in two
particulars: (1) The more <i>commonplace</i> the
plot material, the more subtile the dramatic
art necessary to make it attractive as a play;
(2) The more <i>extraordinary</i> the fact material,
the greater the tact requisite to make it seem
plausibly real. The simple rule is, Dramatize<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
your facts before you employ them! Develop
the dramatic habit in all your five senses; better
still, create a sixth and call it the Sense
of Drama.</p>

<p>Little tragedies, romances and dramas are
constantly happening in the circles of people
with whom we come in daily contact—therein
lies danger, however. More than a mere
change of scene or character is necessary.
The actual, intimate happening must form, if
employed in any degree, but a suggestive plot
germ, or only an episode in an entirely <i>new
story</i>. The best way to avoid disaster in this
relation is to see to it that the development
and elaboration of your resultant plot is not
the same as that of the incident upon which
it was based.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 50.</i>) <i>The almost daily sight of an
old character who is brow-beaten by his entire family,
inspires speculation as to how he lost his nerve and
prestige, possibly a fortune too? For the purpose
of our plot, we say that he gambled away his fortune.
He had a theory of beating the market. He
and his wealthy son-in-law become friends, and before
anyone realizes it he has induced his son-in-law
to put his whole fortune back of the old theory!</i></p>
</div>

<p>The daily newspaper is perhaps the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
prolific source of plot germs. Take special
note that this does not mean <i>complete</i> plots.
The question of originality arises—for suppose
other seekers choose the same news clipping
for development? In answer to this, it may
be said that not two persons in a thousand—providing
they employ only the suggestive
germ and do not try to follow verbatim the
news story—will take the same point of view,
will assume the same mood, will employ the
same plot development, or will choose the
same plot manifestation. True originality
consists in doing the much-done thing in a
new way. Be sure that you are not trite, then
go ahead.</p>

<p>The newspaper is most useful, perhaps, as
a source of novel situations, which are in constant
demand in the development of the photoplay.
We arrive at a pass in the progressive
building of our plot and find that we are
about to use an incident that has been worn
threadbare. If our press clippings are classified,
all we have to do is to turn to the proper
classification, and in all probability we will
make a discovery worth while.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p><div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 51.</i>) <i>Suppose we are seeking some
new way of catching a thief, some of the following
ought to be illuminating: (1) Clue to Leegson Murder;
(2) Join Dictograph to Telephone; (3) Police
Hoax Brings Gunmen’s Capture; (4) Women Sleuths
Catch a Fugitive; (5) Bomb Throwers Trailed by a
Boy. Here are five items of plot material, plot germs
and dramatic situations.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Beware of “true stories” as plots. They
lack the essential ingredients of the fiction
story, or dramatized play. They are loaded
with deadly personal detail that is usually too
localized for the world-sweep of the photodrama.
They need most of their prime facts
ripped out and to be larded with choice bits
of invented detail. True stories make excellent
anecdotes; but not one in a thousand
bears any resemblance to a complete photoplay
plot.</p>

<p>Plot material is useless unless it is stored in
sufficient quantities to enable the consulting
plot seeker to make use of it without being
cramped in his selection. Photoplaywriting is
too arduous labor to resort to slip-shod
methods such as trying to remember items of
plot material. It is part of the author’s business
to store up energy and ideas. The application
of a simple system, along the line of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
that which follows, will permit the playwright
to catalog, classify and file all of his plot material
(notes, clippings, pictures, etc.) in a
manner that will enable him to file or find any
conceivable item instantaneously.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 52.</i>) <i>This classified plot directory and
catalog is elastic and universal. The ambitious student
may readily carry it to completion along the
lines indicated. There are easily a thousand sub-divisions
possible. There are 7 grand divisions: (I)
The Heart of Man; (II) The Ambition of Man; (III)
The Flesh of Man; (IV) The Soul of Man; (V) The
Mind of Man; (VI) Not-Man; (VII) Humor. We
will divide but one of these grand divisions: (I)
THE HEART OF MAN—(1) Man; (2) Woman;
(3) Love; (4) Marriage; (5) Children; (6) Family;
(7) Home; (8) Friendship; (9) Separation; (10) Re-union.
The sub-divisions of (4) Marriage: (a)
Name; (b) Money; (c) Bigamy; (d) Deception; (e)
Beauty; (f) Blunder; (g) Runaway; (h) Miscegenation;
(i) Morganatic; (j) Eugenics.</i></p>
</div>

<p>A final suggestion as a source of plot material
(as well as a harvesting of titles for
plays and stories) is a persistent search for,
and a diligent setting down for future use, of
happy phrases, which may be heard, read or
conceived by the playwright. He will find
that a large percentage of these phrase-titles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
are the nucleus of plots in themselves. In
most cases they suggest the coveted big story.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 53.</i>) <i>The Tides of Fate; When a
Man Cannot Pay; Give Him a Chance; Somebody
Had to Do It; To Those That Have; Who Live in
the Past; The Quality of Youth; For A’ That; For
Good and All; One Chance in a Hundred.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Plot material is the stuff that souls are made
of; it is the composition from which careers
are moulded; it is sparks from the forge of
nobility and salt distilled from the tears of
humanity. Plot material means a record of
man’s activities outside of the four dull walls
of Convention and beyond the dominion of the
Commonplace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>In the first place, we must find something
to write about; some condition, experience or
deed that is worthy of a plot, a story or a play.
As we consider this or that item of plot material,
in our search for a plot germ, we pause
and ask of it: To what end? To what good?
The moment we discern the culmination of a
big moment, or the performance of a decisive
action, or the accomplishment of a great deed,
we have found our plot germ. This is not the
beginning of our play, but its culmination, or
climax. We at once set about to clarify,
strengthen and heighten this climax. The
process should fill us with inspiration, give our
thoughts the impetus of flight and point our
course clear and straight. Thus inspired,
equipped and confident, we set out to begin
our play.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 54.</i>) <i>We may peruse newspapers, read
books, witness plays and give our attention to plot
material in vain and then stumble over a pregnant
plot germ in an unexpected quarter. For instance,
we suddenly discern in our old neighbor whom we
have seen around all our life, a picture of tragedy,
that echoes Lear. He had slouched around the place,
scolded by his wife and brow-beaten by the grown
children until he seemed the acme of the commonplace.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
Tears in his eyes one day suggest a story.
He was the plot material; his tears the plot germ;
how to make the old man happy in the last great moment
of his life, is the climax and aim of the prospective
play.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The climax resolves itself into a definite
purpose to guide the playwright; for he writes
every scene with a view to its influence on the
climax; if it has no influence on the climax,
that is sufficient evidence that it is not necessary
for his play purposes. The writer who
sits down to write his play with no definite
idea of the outcome is bound to be swayed
by every new development that appears on the
horizon of his imagination. His characters
will lead him around by the ears, tweak his
nose and play blind man’s bluff with him—as
the resultant play will show.</p>

<p>We begin our photoplay with the incident
that marks the beginning of the vital relationship
between one of the principal characters
and the climax. The birth of the plot,
however, does not mean the birth of the characters.
The ever-forward trend necessitates
our going back only once—when we begin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p><div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 55.</i>) <i>To resume our plot of Example
54: Having resolved on the climax to bring the
affairs of our old-man hero to the greatest moment
of his life, we must turn now from the facts entirely
and weave our fiction tale: The old man in his
youth was a gambler; he lost the fortune for which
his wife married him; he won his family’s everlasting
disregard; he had always had a “system” which
he knew could beat the market; this is what they all
say; one of his daughters marries a well-to-do,
genial young man; he becomes the old man’s friend;
the old man confides his “system” to him and manages
to make him believe in it; these two plan to
invest all he has; they do; the family discover it
too late; they drive him out; the son-in-law’s fortune
is apparently lost; the tide turns and he wins a
fabulous amount; it is he who brings the old man
back—ready to die now that he has proved his
precious “system.” Since our play concerns the old
man’s relations with his son-in-law, we may properly
begin it just previous to that young man’s engagement
with his daughter. Our first scene could be captioned:
“Ill-treated Half His Life for Losing the
Money Ma Married Him For.” The action would
establish the old man’s relations with his family.
To go back to the old man’s losing his fortune would
be to run the risk of telling another story and
necessitates the “years later” breach in the development.</i></p>
</div>

<p>By a live beginning we mean one that
quickly gets into the heart of the theme with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
as few scenes as possible. It can be done in
the first scene very often, especially if preceded
by a meaty caption. The first scene
must be suggestive at least of the climax.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 56.</i>) <i>In the first scene of “All Power
for a Day” we establish the irrascible character of
Col. Farrington that led to his attack on Ridgway
and his death that brought about the big moment of
the play ... In “The Salt of Vengeance” the
first scene depicts Dalton discovering the rotten
bridge that later precipitated the train that maimed
his child and caused him to seek vengeance.... In
“The Master of the Lost Hills” the letter is
screened that jilts Shelburne and sends him out to
the Lost Hills on the great adventure that makes
the play.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Our course lies between beginning the play
too early and injuring the continuity by
“years-later” breaks; or not beginning it soon
enough and having to resort to explanations,
thru hitching visions, of many important
scenes depending upon something that has
gone before. Try to begin at that point where
the first scene in the vital action occurs; make
the identities powerful and clear; establish relationships
that nothing will efface from the
minds of the audience. Then go ahead with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
as little loss of time as possible, for the audience
is apt to be skeptical at first and sit back
demanding, “Well?”</p>

<p>EACH SCENE CONTRIBUTES TO CLIMAX; ELEMENT
OF TIME AND CHRONOLOGICAL SEQUENCE;
PROBLEMS OF CONTINUITY; THE
CENTRAL THEME; THE RETURN; INSTANTANEOUS
SEQUENCE; TIME INDICATIVES.</p>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>S we have learned, that which happens
in our play happens NOW. All time is
present time, therefore all things must happen
chronologically correct. Whatever period of
time we carry our audience back to in our first
scene constitutes the beginning of all things,
as far as our present purpose is concerned.
Affairs relentlessly and inevitably move forward.
In this relation, special care must be
taken in the screening of simultaneous action
in different scenes. Perfect continuity can be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
maintained always by having the contributory
scenes obviously bear upon the principal
theme, or that which is held in suspense.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 57.</i>) <i>In “The Master of the Lost
Hills” our principal scenes are those picturing the
hero himself. The contributing scenes are those
showing the peril that threatens him. Scene 95 discloses
Shelburne dodging missiles as he barricades
door; 96 shows angry mob outside; 97 gives a rear
view of the house showing his personal enemy building
a fire against shack. Subsequent deeds follow
this simultaneous action.</i></p>
</div>

<p>In the photoplay we have no wait, as in
stage drama, while the scenes are being
shifted, therefore we must have perfect continuity
of time. We cannot digress with
irrelevant matter; we must fill in with contributive
material always. An episode is an
isolated incident that has no place in the
photoplay. The plot begins with the cause of
it all and can never pause until it has arrived
at a satisfactory solution. Lapses of time
should never appear to be gaps or voids, but
become well rounded periods suggestively
filled by artistic construction. We have seen
how only forward or simultaneous action can
win conviction of actuality. A very fine phase<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
of this principle is essential when a vital causal
action demands an immediate view of the effect.
In other words, instantaneous sequences
must follow instantaneously.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 58.</i>) <i>A man is about to commit
suicide in one scene; he lifts the revolver—the next
scene shows his frivolous wife, the cause of it all;
laughing and chatting in the next room; she springs
up suddenly in horror—another scene shows the instant
following the shooting. Or, a man breaking
thru a door in one scene, appears instantly in the
next scene.</i></p>
</div>

<p>This method of showing immediate continuity
is also employed to accelerate action and
maintain suspense. It is called the “cut-back,”
which term has the objectionable quality
of suggesting “going back.” What we do
is to revisit, or <i>return</i>, to a scene previously
screened. The strict application of the “cut-back”—or
Return, as we shall hereafter designate
it—is in the case of a rapid sequence of
action wherein the Return reoccurs for an extended
period in almost every other scene.
We find its abuse in the “chase” picture,
which by some directors is still considered
drama. Rarely we find that one scene need
sustain the action for a longer period than is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
apt to be interestingly safe. In that case we
must break up the scene with one or more Returns
of another scene, or action, that has a
contributive effect on the thematic scene which
we have broken. A long scene may be
broken effectively by the insertion of a Close-view.
All of these constructive possibilities
must be resorted to in building the effective
plot. In other words, we must test each scene
by visualizing it before we write it out. Our
rough draft is our plot, that may be changed
to meet, create and strengthen dramatic exigencies.
Remember that we must suggest
even more than fiction, since we must tell the
director and actor what must be done, as well
as show the audience a moving drama!</p>

<p>Definite actions, or tasks, that take considerable
time in the execution, are readily encompassed
by the Return, or the introduction
of new material of a cumulative nature.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 59.</i>) <i>A mob’s march of a mile or so;
the burning of a house containing prisoners; the digging
of a tunnel in order to escape; the cutting down
of a tree in which the hero is perched—progressive
stages in the task are shown, alternating with scenes
bearing upon the result that readily present themselves
to the playwright.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p><i>A play should progress even when it appears
to go back.</i> This seeming paradox is
concerned especially with the employment of
the Vision. It means that every scene should
contribute action—and every insert supply
data—that advance the play <i>in the mind of the
audience</i>, by indirectly clearing away some
obstacle that has stood in the way of its
further progress, or by supplying material that
heightens lingering suspense, or by directly
adding new action that impetuously drives the
development toward a climax.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 60.</i>) <i>In “The Lost Melody” we are
shown, thru a vision, the picture that is passing thru
Douglas’s mind NOW; its presence was necessary
to clear away the great obstacle that barred Douglas’s
reformation (the Climax); the play bounded forward
in interest as it was visualized.</i></p>
</div>

<p>We do not advance far in the construction
of our photoplay plot before we realize that
variety is the spice of its life. Simplicity of
theme is essential, but simplicity of plot seems
out of the question. This, in a large measure,
is true. It is the parting of the ways from the
short story, for in that the single, simple plot
is essential; in the photoplay the complicated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
plot is not only best but next to essential in
creating cumulative suspense. Our theme
should be so simple that we may state it in a
few words. It is the subject-matter of the
play; the Climax is its direct outcome; our
hero is with it thru thick and thin because his
body and soul are made of it; it is the play.
<i>All else is contributive matter.</i> The theme is
comparable to the main line of a railroad that
is fed and sustained by way-stations and
branch lines; if we expect to reach an important
destination we can arrive only by way
of the main line.</p>

<p>Continuing this view of the complications
as tributary material suggests a method of
plot building that has exceptional merits. We
shall call it the building by dramatic sequences.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 61.</i>) <i>We shall quote “The Coming
of the Real Prince,” in this connection again. A sequence
includes a definite section of action marking
the dramatic crises in the play. In the instance of
this play a caption has designated each sequence. 1.
Annie’s Widowed Mother Left Penniless Opens a
Boarding House; 2. Better Times But No Sympathy
From a Busy Mother; 3. Annie Finds Solace in
“Cinderella”; etc. We take 1. Annie’s Widowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
Mother Left Penniless and append all the tributary
scenes we can conceive; possibly not in the exact
order in which they are finally employed; (a) Arrival
home after the funeral; (b) Failure of the boarding
house; (c) Servants discharged; (d) Annie becomes
the drudge. And so on, in each sequence until the
Climax is reached.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The only rule is to keep as close to the
central theme as possible, for the completed
action must be so perfectly woven that all
matter fits as a perfect whole with no suggestion
of patches, so artistically is the construction
hidden.</p>

<p>The element of time is the secret of logical
sequence in the photoplay—always make certain
that the following scene is without question
the scene that follows. Perfect continuity
insures perfect illusion.</p>

<p>One of the big little problems that lies before
the playwright is to invent a time indicative
without the monotonous mention of
time at all—at least by means of such trite
Captions as “The Next Day,” “Two Years
Later,” “That Night,” etc. Lapses of time in
the continuity of essential action are inevitable.
It is vitally necessary to an appreciation of
the dramatic significance of a scene that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
audience know whether a day or a year has
elapsed. The Caption alone proves to be the
only reliable source of information. The real
difficulty lies in eliminating the aforementioned
type of time indicative.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 62.</i>) <i>The solution seems to rest in
incorporating time significance to the entire Caption
phrase, or at least in transposing the actual time
words from an isolated position to a relative place
in the Caption itself. Instead of, “The Next Day.
Ridgway Returns Tho Forbidden Ever to Trespass;”
why not, “Tho Forbidden Ever to Trespass Ridgway
Returns the Next Day”? It is infinitely stronger.
“Alice Reconciled to Fate HAS BECOME Gov.
Marsten’s Secretary.” “Mrs. Dalton Learns the
Truth AFTER TWO MONTHS’ Deception.”
“AFTER the Operation.” “SUMMER Brings Hope
for Dalton.” (The capitalization is for the student’s
benefit only.)</i></p>

<p>Plot building is simply carrying a dramatic
premise to a dramatic conclusion.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>E have learned that we must create interest
with the very first scene by significant
action, and that our characters must
win admiration or dislike upon their first appearance,
but the fond hopes that we create in
the beginning and excite thruout the development
of the play must not be gratified till the
Climax is reached. Nevertheless, thru painstaking
construction, it is usually the unexpected
that happens in the Climax, tho always
that which is logical and has been the secret
desire of the audience. A premise once advanced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
in the beginning of the plot must be
conclusively proved, right or wrong, in the
issue of the Climax; that is all there is to the
play.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 63.</i>) <i>In the plot introduced in Example
53, we picture the old man in such a way that
he wins the audience’s immediate sympathy and thus
premise and promise to do all in our play-power to
win his emancipation from abuse. We make the
audience hope that he will win out with his “system”
that once lost his fortune. To put every obstacle
we can in his path marks the dramatic development
of the plot; to remove them is the part of the Climax—providing
it is not designed to be a tragedy.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Climax brings the suspense to its summit
and determines the outcome of the play in a
single scene. What follows should be rapidly
disposed of, and constitutes the Conclusion.
The most effective drama is that which concludes
with and is one with the Climax. This
leaves an impression with the audience that
minor details in a drawn-out Conclusion often
efface.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 64.</i>) <i>In “The Salt of Vengeance,”
the Climax comes in Scene 39; Dalton makes a superhuman
effort to wave his handkerchief with the
speeding train bearing down on him. 40 shows the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
cab of the engine, closing the throttle just in time.
41 shows the Climax still sustained but waning;
Dalton has collapsed and the little girl whom he had
risked his life to save, running toward him. 42 is the
real Conclusion taken some time later with inimical
factions all united in perfect happiness. In “All
Power for a Day,” we find the Climax and Conclusion
synonymous; Marsten, who has hampered, jailed
and almost had our hero executed for a murder he
himself had committed. The release of the hero and
accusation drives him to suicide. The hero claims
the heroine and they are handed a telegram for
Marsten which tells them that Marsten has won that
for which he had labored all his life—he is dead; it
is the hero who holds all things. That is the end of
the play.</i></p>
</div>

<p>That our characters are married, have children
and live happily forever after, are separate
outgrowths of our present play and require
a new plot to handle any story they may
contain. The play deals solely with removing
the obstacles that stand in the way of our
hero in his accomplishment of a definite object.
The obstacles once removed, his object
must be within his grasp, if the play is properly
plotted. Preliminary to the Climax, the
plot deck must be cleared for a decisive action;
minor characters must be disposed of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
and nothing permitted to interfere with the
titanic struggle for supremacy between the
hero and his foes. The instant one or other
receives the mortal blow, our plot has achieved
its purpose; our tale is told; our play is over.</p>

THE DRAMATIC IDEA; EMOTION IS
THE SECRET; DESIRE THE MOTIVE POWER;
DRAMA AND MELODRAMA.</p>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">P</span>HOTODRAMA is—as we all know—a
coherent series of animated photographs
projected life-like and life-size on a screen,
realistically visualizing a dramatic story. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
one word “animated” eliminates forever the
authority to employ the word “picture” in this
relation. “Moving pictures” or “motion pictures”
may be pictures that are standing, or
moving, or dancing, or jumping—for all the
adjective suggests—but it is impossible to
make the term synonymous with photodrama.
It is, to say the least, a misnomer that misleads—especially
the playwright. Photodrama is
not pictures, but <i>life</i>!</p>

<p>The man who writes photoplays should
study and master the principles of dramatic
construction. Before all things he is a playwright.
Later he will learn that photodrama
is the older dramatic art and something beside,
requiring a new type and a new school
of artists. He will learn that what is in demand
with fiction and stage drama is in vogue
with the photodrama. He should realize by
this time that dramatic art is both a faithful
reflection of the vital and contemporaneous
emotional, mental and spiritual life of the civilized
world, and an appeal to the elemental
passions of humanity. With the perpetuating
of existing literature and drama in photoplay
form, the independent playwright will have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
little to do, as this work usually falls to the
lot of the staff writer. It is collaborative
rather than creative work.</p>

<p>As plot is the science of structure, so dramatics
is the art of treatment. Plot is a matter
of selection; drama one of application of the
selected material. We take it for granted that
all plot material is inherently—tho crudely,
perhaps—dramatic. We hint at both plot and
treatment when we state that drama is a supreme
human experience interpreted by characters
in terms of emotion with piercing effect.
It is the clash of soul against soul in visualized
struggle. It is spiritual conflict. It is not the
contention of ideas merely, for that could be
expressed only in words; nor is it the strife of
matter, for that could be expressed only in
dynamic and spectacular action—it is a clash
of interests that involves both.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 65.</i>) <i>In the play “The Struggle”
(Kalem) the methods of producers in going out of
their way to make spectacle of drama is shown. The
plot was built on the idea of the struggle of Labor
against Capital, which in itself is essentially dramatic.
The dramatic construction developed two characters
symbolising their respective classes. The contrast
was essentially dramatic. They were made to see—not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
each other’s strength to crush and kill, but each
other’s power of human kindness under the test of
sympathy. That was the idea of the author. The
following line on the posters shows that the producers
had ideas of their own which substituted
spectacle for drama: “See the great iron mill in
operation and the sensational rescue from fire!”
Neither of these contingencies had been a part of the
original play!</i></p>
</div>

<p>Thus we find our first essential is to make
sure that our plot germ is dramatic. Our plot
development has conditions and needs of its
own that carry us forward logically to the
point of successful treatment. Finally, we are
prepared to proceed with our dramatic construction,
which is to convert a mechanical
framework into an appealing play. Plot construction
is a matter of form; dramatic construction
one of effect. Provided the plot
construction is excellent, dramatic construction
resolves itself into the task of arrangement
and re-arrangement of the matter contained
in the plot.</p>

<p>The secret of all dramatic effects is emotional
impression on the audience. To endure,
such an impression must contain a big dramatic
idea; one that involves an emotional experience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
that, <i>under the given circumstances</i>,
might happen to anybody anywhere. Love,
Sacrifice, Honor, Reconciliation, Re-union and
Retribution are a few of the great themes that
never fail to stir the hearts of audiences the
world over. The success of the photoplaywright
lies in his dramatic skill and originality
in weaving new situations from old relationships.</p>

<p>Addison’s statement of the nature and qualifications
of drama still stands: “First, there
must be one action; secondly, it must be an
entire action; thirdly, it must be a great
action.”</p>

<p>Melodrama is pure drama exaggerated.
The hero and the heroine are very, very
good; the villain and the adventuress are very,
very bad; their manner is extraordinarily violent;
their method is to startle both the audience
and each other by their actions and
deeds; all emotion with them is passion; they
accomplish superhuman tasks and are generally
untrue to all conception of real life.
Daring spectacle is one of their favorite resources.</p>

things. The dramatist deliberately sets about
to make the hour that an audience gives to
seeing his play become one of the greatest

conduct of the characters, or actors. Great
danger lies in the playwright’s failure to understand
and appreciate the marked difference
between movement and action. Movement is
the internal undercurrent of real dramatic
progression. That actors come and go rapidly
across the screen, or that their actions shall be
violent or punctuated with gestures, is not by
any means sufficient. Actions must express
and portray an internal struggle with which
the audience is in sympathetic understanding.
There must be an underlying emotional meaning
for every prominent action that is displayed
on the screen. Thus the dramatic element
is perceived by the audience thru its
effect upon the characters and their consequent
actions. This is called motive, as well
as movement; it begins and continues in the
guise of cumulative insinuations from the very
first scene, reaching its full stage of development
in the climax. This requires the most
skillful and technical execution on the part of
the playwright, who must throw his whole
soul into it without once showing his hand.
In other words, dramatic effects must come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
about as naturally as the normal actions of the
characters. Too often photoplays are nothing
more than a series of continued pictures, anyone
or more of which might be cut out without
affecting the final scene. To the contrary,
drama is a living thing, and amputation will
either maim, or mar, or kill it outright.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 66.</i>) <i>A single scene from a play in
which a girl who has discovered and developed a
talent in a man is thrown off by him in the moment
of his triumph, shows the difference between Movement
and Action: (Action) Forbes is standing in the
center of the room, the lion of the hour; ladies
crowding around him in excited contest; one seems
to get the major share of attention. (Movement)
Alica, the heroine, enters with joy and pride on her
face; steps forward to shake his hand; at first he
pretends he does not know her; then accompanies
his handshake with a curt nod; turning away almost
rudely to the other woman.... Showing that the
chief difference lies in action affecting the character
and movement affecting the audience.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Movement, then, is that which is felt more
than it is seen. It brings us face to face again
with the power of suggestion, which is one of
the secret springs of dramatic effects. By
means of it everything is made to play a
dramatic part in our drama.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 67.</i>) <i>In a scene picturing the hour
a man has selected to declare his love, we find a
moonlight effect; they sing a love song; “the time,
the place and the girl” are all harmonious....
In another scene we depict this man’s poverty by
showing his threadbare room; there are many suggestions
of better days; his manner shows refinements
that suggest his former affluence and make his
surroundings pathetically dramatic.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The finer points in dramatic construction
are equivalent—and just as necessary—as
those of fiction narration. Dramatic construction
and expression are modulated according
to the nature of the theme. Realism, Romanticism
and Idealism each has its methods of
producing effects. We must guard against
the vulgarity of ultra-realism and bear in mind
that all idealism must be edifying and romanticism
refined. Realism is materialistic and
calls for gross details and convincing spectacle;
Romanticism is luxuriant and revels in
the vagaries of youth, the desire for love and
the intoxication of adventure; Idealism is delicate
and speculates in beauty, dreams and perfection.
The three are like solids, oil and
water that can never mix. If our play be a
romance, its contributive elements must be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
romantic to produce the desired romantic
effect.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 68.</i>) <i>The three plays following are
examples of Realism, Romanticism and Idealism,
as their titles appropriately suggest: “The Salt of
Vengeance,” “The Coming of the Real Prince” and
“The Lost Melody.” The first is a play of revenge
and does not mince matters in delineating it; there
is a wreck, a thrilling hold-up scene and a sacrifice
involving bloodshed. The second shows the blowing
and bursting of the romantic bubble of a visionary
country girl. The third depicts the effect of a youthful
ideal upon a man later in life.</i></p>
</div>

<p>There are grave dangers, as we have hinted,
in substituting dynamic or spectacular action
for dramatic movement, as illustrated in the
foregoing chapter by Example 65. Even melodrama
can be ruined by it. The toppling over
of a house, the realistic battle between two
armies, or the smashing of two locomotives,
obliterates the fine mechanism of the drama
with a realism that satiates and makes everything
that follows insipid. The play, the
characters and the audience are lost in the
debris both literally and artistically. Our object
in dramatic expression is to enthrall, not
to paralyze. Every distraction of attention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
from the elemental mediums of pure art is an
obstacle thrown into the clear channel of receptivity.
Spectacles are for the most part
acts that concern themselves and not <i>deeds</i>
that are an intrinsic part of the drama. The
characters and the action step back as it were,
while the precipitated spectacle usurps the
stage and the attention. Unlike the circus,
drama has no legitimate side-shows. We are
not interested in anything that happens or that
a character may do, but only in what his action
indicates and reveals of the story. Spectacles
are real “moving pictures”; what we
want is moving drama. True drama appeals
to the heart; spectacular theatrics assault the
nerves.</p>

<p>We should employ the spectacle then, not
as an adjunct to drama, but as a vital necessity—which
will be rarely. When you can
honestly say that what you have written is
good drama, and that you cannot do without
one or more spectacular scenes, then make use
of them by all means.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>EQUENCE in photodrama may almost
without exception be called consequence,
so continuous and binding are the presence and
relationship of cause and effect thruout the
photoplay. The very first scene must contain
a definite cause, followed by more or less suspense
until the effect is revealed. Each effect
develops a new cause for suspense which accumulates
in volume—if skillfully constructed—until
it becomes an almost unendurable burden
of expectation, speculation and anxiety in
the Climax, or biggest Situation, wherein it is
effectively solved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 69.</i>) <i>In the first scene of “The Master
of the Lost Hills,” the hero’s fiancée writes him that
she is jilting him. This is really the cause of the
entire play that does not find complete solution until
the last scene. The second scene of the play
shows us the effect of the first upon the hero. Hard
hit, he turns from his irresponsible life. Seeing his
valet sending annual gifts to the poor whites on his
Southern estate becomes the cause of which his
sudden departure to the estate of Lost Hills in
person is the effect. The startling adventures that
follow are the logical consequences.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Unless scenes are fragmentary, that is mere
supplementary “flashes,” an analysis will disclose
a uniformity of development, that has a
counterpart in the structure of the play itself,
namely: Introduction, Situation, Crisis and
Solution.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 70.</i>) <i>We take a scene from “All
Power for a Day,” wherein Ridgway is discovered
by his sweetheart with a gun in his hand and suspected
of killing her father who lies dying on the
floor: (Introduction) Servants rushing in; Ridgway
discovered with smoking revolver in his hand gazing
dully at Colonel who lies writhing on floor....
(Situation) Alice enters, rushes to father’s side. He
points accusingly at Ridgway.... (Suspense) Ridgway
comes forward pleadingly; Alice hesitates and
starts at what her father is saying; at length nods<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
yes.... (Crisis) Alice repulses Ridgway with a
gesture; father falls back dead.... (Solution—at
least of the scene in hand) The sheriff enters and
arrests Ridgway.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The progressive effects of scene or play are
due to arrangement, as may readily be seen.
Each minor effect, tho begun in the first scene,
must heighten and tighten the Climax. It accomplishes
this by bearing constantly and
cumulatively upon the main theme of the play.
No matter how many contributive scenes may
be necessary, the main theme, or medium, must
again predominate. We should engender suspense
by so arranging incidents that a vital
desire is manifested in the character first;
many things may happen before the next unit
of sustaining suspense rises—Opportunity to
gratify the Desire; the third unit of prolonging
suspense is the Frustration of the Opportunity
to gratify the Desire. On the other
hand, suspense is terminated immediately by
the advent of Change, Decision or Fulfillment.
The instant that the playwright feels that suspense
is being overstrained, he should bring
it to a close. The minor incidents of suspense
are not closed, however, until they have disposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
of themselves by contributing an element
of suspense to the main theme that will
be felt in the climax itself. For, after all, suspense
is merely a suspension of the Climax;
each suspension is marked by a crisis, or
minor climax. We sustain interest by suspending
the Climax.</p>

<p>In drama nothing should be left to motiveless
chance, or raw coincidence. Suspense is
a promissory note to the audience that the
culmination they have been waiting for is
worth while, and not a hoax by the author or
a termination by an “act of God.”</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 71.</i>) <i>Writers often get their characters
in a dilemma that defies solution on their part,
upon which an unsuspected treasure is made to
appear; or an unhinted-at rescuing party helps the
author and hero out; or someone “marries the girl”
rather than leave her unprovided for at the conclusion
of the play; or it becomes necessary to kill
off the unpunished villain or hero-who-has-gone-to-the-bad.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Suspense is much stronger than mere expectation.
We may say that expectation is
the hope that something will happen; <i>suspense
is the fear that something may happen</i>.
Suspense is not always occasioned by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
emotional strain of the character; that is only
tension of action. If there is an emotional
strain on the audience, then there is sheer suspense.
The most dramatic suspense is possible
thru the suggestion of impending catastrophe
of which the character is blithely and emotionally
ignorant, but of which the audience
has seen ominous portents in alternating
scenes. Thus, in photoplay, we are permitted
the excitement of seeing the progress of both
sides in the battle of opposing motives. For in
drama we must have the swiftly-moving motive
as well as the big idea. The course of
dramatic sequence follows the line of this
motive, the only deviations being those made
for the purpose of creating suspense.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE most poignant dramatic effect is that
obtained by contrasting a character with
his most coveted—tho ungratified—condition.
The most powerful situations are those in
which a character is confronted with that
which should have been, that which might
might have been, or that which can never be.
Therein we plunge into the deepest wells of
pathos.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 72.</i>) <i>As a case of that which should
have been, we find the man who failed suddenly
coming into the presence of the man who is prosperous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
because of his failures. That which might have
been, we see illustrated in the man and woman meeting
years later—the husband and wife of others—when
a silly misunderstanding is all that separated
them. That which can never be is pathetically shown
by an old man making the acquaintance of a youth,
who alone can accomplish what he himself wishes to
do. These are all dramatic situations of the highest
order.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Since drama is an artistic process of obtaining
striking and gratifying effects upon
the emotions of an audience, the situation is
the most frequent and positive means to that
end. The situation is what lends novelty, fire
and brilliancy to the progressive units of the
play. It places the characters in a galvanic
relationship with each other or with their condition
or environment. It means the introduction
of the unexpected—either from the
point of view of the character or of the audience.
Its introduction marks the beginning of
Suspense, and raises the question, What will
he do about it? For it means a relationship
about which something must be done immediately,
and that something is a Crisis. The
Situation itself is of short duration but of
tremendous power and effect. It succeeds the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
introductory action, or a sudden revealment to
the audience, of which the character may remain
in ignorance, or an unlooked-for entry,
or an undreamed-of relationship disclosed—that
suddenly change the whole aspect of
development.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 73.</i>) <i>A woman’s old father has sent
for the police to arrest the young criminal whom he
has raised from a foundling—when the daughter
discloses that the boy is her illegitimate son, and his
grandson! A girl betrays a man to the mob for murdering
her wealthy benefactor whom she has never
seen—when it is seemingly too late the man proves
to her that he is the benefactor, and that her brother
murdered his valet! In both cases the audience was
aware of the relationship and reveled in the characters’
embarrassment.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The foregoing Example has touched a point
that should be driven home. It concerns the
extent to which the author shall take the audience
into his confidence. In this relation,
writers will have to discard in photoplay writing
what in story writing is undoubtedly one
of their greatest assets; namely, the withholding
of some of the important details in order to
build the delightful surprise at the end. In
the photoplay we must take the audience into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
our confidence, for the simple reason that
everything is screened in the order of its occurrence.
That is the first principle of perfect
illusion—perfect continuity. The second principle
is, that all that is essential must occur
on the screen, which is the principle of perfect
progression. Both the spoken drama and the
fiction story permit a development that is contrary
to these principles of photodrama. The
writer of those forms builds up a fabric of deception,
as it were, around the real events that
hides the truth and makes it seem as tho it
were just the opposite—until the grand surprise
at the end. He does this by means of
cleverly framed innuendoes, artificial explanations
offered by various persons in the play
or story and the delay of misleading evidence
that is cleared up in speeches and dialog, that
in turn explains why they made the mistakes.
The photoplay gains power by being more
direct.</p>

<p>We do not try to outwit our audiences; we
take them into our confidence. If we can do
this cleverly and suggestively, we can equal,
if not surpass, any of the effects to be obtained
by other forms of dramatic expression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 74.</i>) <i>We see a crime about to be
committed, but all of the criminal that appears is a
hand—possibly scarred—slipping thru the parting of
the portières. When the hero who was robbed or
assaulted by that hand finds the ring, the audience
finds the criminal. Another instance of showing
the essential progressive action, but reserving the full
disclosure till the climacteric Situation, is found in
the finding of a woman’s lost boy by the man she
loves. Later she is led to believe that the boy has
gone the evil way he started for. She comes to the
man she had scorned, for help; the man takes her
to a boy’s school where her boy is the leader. We
had only seen the lover find the boy and then we returned
to the main line of action.</i></p>
</div>

<p>But are not the audiences’ hopes and fears
heightened by omniscence? Their knowledge
does not mean foreknowledge, by any means.
The hero must work out his own salvation and
overcome the villain just the same. The fact
that they know that the hero is sitting on the
box that contains the treasure for which he is
looking is a hundred times more dramatic
than if they are not told till the end, when
the circumstance may be forgotten. The
finest Situations are those wherein he does not
realize the true state of affairs that the foregoing
scene has fully disclosed to the audience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 75.</i>) <i>In “Madame X” we find the
young barrister defending his own mother who has
committed murder. At first neither mother nor son
is aware of it. The audience knows, and this knowledge
makes of this scene one of the most powerful
Situations in all Drama.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The Close-View—in the capacity of showing
only a small portion of the physical action
magnified—is most effective in producing Situations.
Again, it brings that to the knowledge
of the spectator of which the recipient is
blithely ignorant.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 76.</i>) <i>A Close-View shows us the
hand of the villain stealing the priceless scarf-pin;
or the hero’s wallet that means his all.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Or again, the Close-View can bring close
what the audience witnesses almost unemotionally
from a distance, possibly showing the
burglar’s ugly face where they saw but a head
in the foliage. The Close-View is, in fact, one
of the most effective devices at the command
of the playwright.</p>

<p>The Caption, too, is capable of doing service
as a Situation, by rousing a thrill in drama
just as they rouse a laugh in comedy. Our
difficulty in this relation is to prevent it from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
robbing the scene, or scenes, to follow of
surprise or suspense.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 77.</i>) <i>The following strengthens a
fact that has half-dawned in the mind of the audience.
Without the Caption the fact would have
passed without particular notice: “Mrs. Donnelly
Handles Dalton’s Deadly Messenger, Neither Dreaming
That She Is the Intended Victim.” Again we
impress a Situation that must not be lost sight of:
“Marsten Thinks the Mortgage Lost That Has
Slipped Into the Lining of the Coat.”</i></p>
</div>

<p>Thus we have seen that even infinitesimal,
tho important, points may be made potential
Situations by bringing them “down front” in
the spot-light, or giving them the advantages
obtained thru introspection in fiction.</p>

<p>Death in itself is neither dramatic nor a
Situation. Drama is dependent on life, struggle
and complication; and a Situation may be
evolved out of a perilous circumstance in
which the character is threatened with death.
A Situation always germinates further life-action;
death terminates a line of action and
eliminates forever an active participant.
Death is never the Climax, but the end.</p>

<p>Since Situations are a matter of such consequence
to the playwright, it behooves him to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
harvest them with the same diligence that he
garners plot material. He may readily file
and classify them under the same captions and
sub-divisions as he does his plot material.
Again, the same sources of material are
available, especially the daily press, which
graciously condenses Situations and Climaxes
in the large type of its head-lines.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 78.</i>) <i>Ten are chosen at random from
current newspapers: (1) Bee Upsets Big Auto; (2)
Deceived by His Valet; (3) Two Women Claim Boy;
(4) Finds Woman Stowaway; (5) Claims Wife—She
Laughs; (6) Woman Gives Away Coins (7)
Prince Weds a Commoner; (8) President Is Captured;
(9) Blind Man Made to See; (10) Identified
by X-Ray.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Among the great number of technical
terms that photoplaydom has acquired is one
identified with literary work-shop slang as
well—the “Punch.” It is more expressive
than elegant, however. The Punch is the
Climax and something more. It must first
be an effective Climax; secondly, it is the effect
of that Climax. The Punch is the momentous
event that is the excuse for the play.
It is the tremendous moment of revealment,
when the dramatic struggle that has waged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
uncertainly from side to side suddenly pitches
forward with the victor for good and all—just
as the audience had been schooled either
to hope or be afraid that it would. The issue
of the Climax-Punch must be sufficient to
make the audience literally hold its breath, or
emotionally rise to the occasion. It is the
thing that hits you square between the eyes
with an effect that stuns and lasts. If a play
has no Punch, it is not a perfect play.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 79.</i>) <i>In “The Coming of the Real
Prince,” the Climax of the first part was the coming
of the bogus prince; the Punch came at the end of
play when the real prince came. The first was a
city “tin horn Sport”; the second was the plain
grocer’s boy, who had been Annie’s neighbor all her
life, and a real prince too—that was the Punch!</i></p>
</div>

<p>The Punch, then, is the motive-idea of the
play summed up in a cumulative stroke. It
bears the same relation to the story that the
climax does to the plot. It is not the big
culminating action so much as it is the effect
that dawns on the audience. It is the emotional
truth of the author’s vision come home
to dwell in the heart of each one who sees the
vision. The Punch is the recognition by the audience
of a visible symbol of spiritual struggle.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">U</span>NITY resolves itself into a rule of
reasonable cause; Harmony becomes
solely a matter of consistent effect. Unity has
to do with selection, and is a part of the plot;
Harmony with arrangement, and is essential
to dramatic expression. One is the perfect relation
of the parts; the other the perfect expression
of the whole.</p>

<p>First of all, there are unities of language
that must be observed to insure perspicuity,
precision and perfect presentation of the idea.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
This demands a command of words, a knowledge
of grammar and an exercise of rhetoric.
The illiterate writer is beyond imagining and
might be compared with a blind painter or a
mute singer. The next step toward eventual
harmony is the choice of an appropriate idea
and a subsequent coherent development. The
units of development should not merely stick
together; they must <i>cling</i> to each other. Thus
we fulfill the unities of impression, which is
the simpler part of our task.</p>

<p>Perfect unity in expression is harmony.
There is a measure, a key, a pitch, a tone—or
a color scheme, if you will—that cannot be
violated. The main theme is the refrain, or
motif, to which we continually hark back,
until we build up a volume of melody that releases
itself in a grand finale of harmony. We
describe a crescendo—tho it is not a perfect
arc, in that its highest point is near the end
instead of the center, when it descends rapidly
to the plane of its beginning. That is the
mark of the perfect artistic production: Balance,
the last bar pitched in the same keynote
as the first! This suggests the entire play
in a single effective impression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 80.</i>) <i>In the first scene of “The
Master of the Lost Hills,” Shelburne receives a letter
from Petronella Dupuyster saying that she is
jilting him for Baron Komisky. The blow shatters
his ideas of women, and he cynically thinks none of
them is worth while.... In the last scene it is the
morning of his coming marriage to Mary. He reads
an item in the paper saying Petronella is seeking
divorce from her bogus “Baron”; Mary enters and
he takes her in his arms, making it clear that he has
found THE woman.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Every element must be in unison, then, in
the perfect play. The poetic play must be
rendered every <i>artificial</i> aid available to delineate,
identify and appeal to poetic <i>feeling</i>.
The same is true of romantic, realistic, idealistic,
or any other specific type. Each play,
for that matter, has its own peculiar exigencies
that call for unity auxiliaries for the sake
of harmony. The character must have his
consistent traits, condition must have its appropriate
environment, situations may be
heightened by setting, deeds are strengthened
by atmosphere—just as the effect is enhanced
by harmony. Thus we disclose one of the
most vital reasons why the least element in the
play should become a factor in the Climax;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
why it should contribute to, color, culminate
and sustain the desired effect of totality to be
left in the mind of the audience.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 81.</i>) <i>In “The Lost Melody” we begin
with the Caption: “Malcolm Decides to Wait
and Make His Proposal to Rosalie an Artistic Occasion.”
This typifies Malcolm’s character that loves
to luxuriate in his own dreams. We next find him
a collector of rare jewels, of which his business-like
rival, Douglas, only realizes the monetary value.
The night of the proposal, Rosalie mistakes Malcolm’s
dreaming for lackadaisical disregard. Douglas seizes
the opportunity and proposes. The setting is a
glorious, lover-like night. They sing the melody
that intoxicates Malcolm and sobers Douglas. When
Malcolm has detached himself from his ideal state,
he finds Rosalie in Douglas’ arms. They part forever.
Douglas, true to his type of sordid materialism,
rises and falls thru his desire for money. Malcolm
becomes the big artist we have felt he might be.
And so, till the lost melody is found again, we find a
potent strain of harmonizing units building a persistent
effect that will haunt the audience after seeing
the play.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The literal construction of the photoplay
has evolved a method of writing the manuscript
that peculiarly lends itself to the composition
of dramatic “business.” While action
is the language of emotion, brevity vivifies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
action. Terseness is a potential factor, then,
in the construction of the manuscript, and
there are several ways in which terseness may
be suggestively conveyed thru the physical
treatment of written action. In this connection,
we must bear in mind that verbs are
natively <i>action words</i>; adjectives are color or
quality words; and adverbs are essentially
drama words.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 82.</i>) <i>A simple analysis of the fiction
value of the nine parts of speech reveals that (1)
ARTICLE is insignificant and is to be used as little
as possible; (2) ADJECTIVE is a quality word that
visualizes the image and description cannot do without
it; (3) NOUN tells what or who we are talking
about; have no more nouns than you want the
reader to see objects, and no object unless it is
clearly visible; (4) VERB is the action word, the
dynamo of emotion, the important word in drama;
(5) PRONOUN is he, she or it—nothing more and
the noun is always to be used in preference, if its
repitition permits; (6) ADVERB is the word of
color, manner, time, subtilety, charm and emotion and
tells HOW, which is what the reader wants to know;
(7) CONJUNCTION joins together qualities, objects,
groups and may connect short statements and
break long ones; (8) INTERJECTION is the less artful
way of expressing emotion; (9) PREPOSITION<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
is the word of passing, the bridge, pause at it and
you have suspense.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The Synopsis, while it does not permit of
unctuous detail, yet there seems no reason why
it should not follow the rules of all narration
and be written tersely, but in full, rounded
sentences, instead of in the abbreviated forms
suggested for the Scenario.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 83.</i>) <i>Some writers employ the
comma thruout the entire scene: “Donnelly reading
over letter girl has written, scowls, roars for girl,”
etc. Others use the dash in the same manner: “Donnelly
reading letter—scowls—” etc. A more effective
way is suggested by the use of the semi-colon and
the use of sentences. Each sentence is to mark
either all the consecutive action of one character, or
the short sequences of action in which possibly all
the characters are involved: “Donnelly reading over
letter girl has just handed him; scowls; roars for
girl; reprimands her brutally. Boy enters; says
Dalton is outside; Donnelly shakes his head can’t
see him; boy says it is urgent. Donnelly nods and
turns belligerently to receive Dalton.” There is
vivacity in the short periods and the reader almost
instantly falls into the recurring sequences with
perfect understanding.</i></p>
</div>

<p>We come to the conclusion at length that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
idea, technique, situation or dramatic atmosphere
alone is not the thing, but the <i>harmony</i>
of all of these. And in attaining this harmony
we find that delineation is essential, while description
is incidental, for the simple reason
that the characters and setting describe themselves
the instant they are seen. The physical
picture saves all the space fiction devotes to
visualization.</p>

<p>There is nothing more distracting to harmony
than the method of some directors in
accelerating action by means of perpetual short
scenes, regardless of the nature of the theme.
If used to excess, this continued employment
of the Return sinks its subject to the low level
of the “chase” picture that was the curse of
the early attempts at dramatic depiction. The
time will come, it is hoped, when the chase,
the crude pantomime and the actor who flirts
with the audience, will become taboo just as
the telephone dialog, the soliloquy and the
aside are avoided in the best spoken dramas.
Both the Return and the Flash are merely
alternatives to be employed as special devices
for special occasions and not stable units upon
which the entire play may be built. They are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
merely effective accelerators of contributive
action and secondary to the main theme.</p>

<p>Unity is agreeable accord; harmony is artistic
concord. Unity is a perfect assemblage
of the parts (seen from the constructive viewpoint);
harmony is the spontaneous chord
shed by the newly created instrument (felt
from its perfect operation). In unity we make
the parts absolutely consistent with well-known
rules; in harmony we make the whole naturally
real according to the principles of life and
experience.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, the photodrama is not
governed by the so-called Dramatic Unities,
restricting dramatic operation to a single
Time, Place and Action. For the photodrama,
thru the latitude permitted in its multitudinous
scenes, may cover continents and span generations.
The old order remains unchanged in
the matter of Action—there can be but <i>one</i>
Action. There is an axiom in drama, however,
that applies equally to spoken drama and
to screen drama: The nearer a play approximates
the actual time consumed in a definite,
continuous and centered story that it represents,
the more convincing is its effect likely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
to be. In other words, if the consumation of
a deed required exactly fifty minutes in actuality
and took fifty minutes to be acted, it would
be a perfect unity in point of time. But how
rare it is to conceive a deed, every consecutive
second of which is dramatically worth while!</p>

<p>Finally we come to the harmonious element
that appears first on the manuscript, but is
conceived wisely last—the Title. The title
must fit the play like a glove, and hide its complete
nature as tho it were a glove.</p>

<p>Fortunately, photoplays are not chosen—by
either public or producers—because of their
titles, as books and short stories are often
selected. Yet, because of the seeming lack of
importance attached to this part of the play,
writers, editors and manufacturers do not
always accord it the important place it deserves,
and will eventually demand. Good,
fitting and perfect titles to plays are a distinct
commercial asset, beside being a requisite to
artistic and harmonious completeness. The
title is the head, the handle, the greeting, the
introduction, the pleasing personality, the cue
and the bid to favor of the as-yet unread
manuscript and the as-yet unseen play. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
title should be exquisite—like a finely-carved
casket, obviously containing a precious treasure—its
exterior suggesting mystery, wonder,
and delight that must follow its revealment.
The title must suggest the individuality of the
play without revealing its identity as shown
thru development, climax and denouement.</p>

<p>Unity we may find if we look for it; Harmony
cannot be discovered by the keenest
critic, for it is not hand-made but born. When
the flesh and form of the play is perfectly
built, Harmony enters in a breath—it is the
soul of the play! Harmony is the last word
of drama!</p>

OTHER FORMS; “SPLIT REEL”; SHORT PLAY;
LONG PLAY; SPECTACLE; ADAPTATIONS; PLAY
DIVISIONS.</p>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">P</span>HOTOPLAY audiences arrived at a
stage of mature understanding and
appreciation of the photodrama long before
the manufacturers and producers had emerged
from the jungle of crudity. The latter are
inclined to remain money-makers and not become
art producers; they are filling their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
pockets today from the emptied brains of
yesterday and forcing tomorrow to go begging.
With few exceptions the plain drama
is exaggerated into melodrama, startling the
audiences thru the violent acts of the characters,
or dynamic spectacle, or extraordinary
setting—rather than thru the simple medium
of pure dramatic construction that stirs the
imagination and sways the emotions with a
semblance of real experience. Drama is one
of life’s exquisite emotional phenomena
brought home to an audience thru the pictured
experience of others.</p>

<p>Melodrama is easiest to write, since it is all
high-lights and black shadows. It demands
the concoction of a series of violence and
spectacle to happen in a logical and progressive
order. Melodrama resembles farce, in
that the characters are cursed with all the earmarks
of the deepest-dyed type they portray—the
beetle-browed villain, or the ludicrous Jew-Irishman-Nigger.
In the true drama we meet
men and women who live poignantly in our
lives—tho we see them for the first time.
The melodramatists had things their way because
the few artists had no co-operation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>Comedy is most difficult to write, and is
easiest to sell—meaning, of course, pure
comedy. It is more difficult, for instance, to
keep an audience laughing for twenty minutes
than it is to keep them in suspense over a
dramatic story for an hour or more. The
photo-counterpart of the Play of Manners, or
the Polite Comedy, is bound to become one
of the future developments of the Photodrama.
Photoplay Comedy has been in the
hands of the Philistines since its inception.
Rarely do we see anything but the rollicking
farce. Polite Comedy has its exquisite moments
that mingle delighted smiles with pathetic
tears; Rollicking Comedy is all wide-mouthed
laughter.</p>

<p>If we are careful in distinguishing from its
coarser parasite—“slap-stick” farce—we may
say that Rollicking Comedy is an art worthy
of one’s serious effort. There are certain
temperaments, however, incapable of comedy
in any form. These playwrights are self-conscious
of their failing! The Polite Comedy
is marked by grace, repression and humor.
It is a delicate cameo of the serious drama—only
it avoids the villainies, perils and horrors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
of life, substituting in their place the failings,
fantasies and prejudices that are both humorously
and pathetically human.</p>

<p>In the Rollicking Comedy, then, <i>everything
must be comical</i>. The term “everything” is
imperative; it means idea, title, plot, every
situation, every scene, every insert, every reference,
every character, every setting, every
action, every suggestion. “It is to laugh!”
Comedy demands exhaustive treatment of
detail. It is insufficient to say that a character
performs an act in a funny way; we must tell
in detail how the action is done to make it so
funny. Comedy must always be delineated
good-naturedly, and never with satire or
animus. Misfortune is not a comedy subject.</p>

<p>In all good drama—whether it be drama,
melodrama, comedy or tragedy—there must be
an idea in the material, a motive in the characterization,
a definite end to be attained; a
reasonable cause, a logical effect and a climacteric
deed; a plot.</p>

<p>In all drama there is struggle with an
obstacle. In pure drama and melodrama we
have the hero struggling against the obstacles
and pitfalls placed in his path by the villain;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
in comedy the character struggles against the
ludicrous situations that rise in his course; in
tragedy evil circumstances overwhelm the
hero no matter how heroic his struggles
are against them.</p>

<p>The reel, or unit of photoplay length, has
both its advantages and its disadvantages.
The “Split reel” play is under a disadvantage.
If it be only a plotless farce—which it is most
frequently—it makes little difference, since
that form is only a fragment, or series of
them.</p>

<p>There are many ways in which the Short
Play—or one-reel—may be compared to the
Short Story, and the Long Play—or multiple-reel—to
the Novel. The Short Play, is intensive
in method. We pursue the development
swiftly and relentlessly from the opening
scene to the culmination.</p>

<p>The Long Play is not a Short Play amplified—as
we so often see them padded. It is
not in any sense a Short Play told in two or
more parts (or reels). Each part (or reel) of
the Long Play, like each chapter of the Novel,
is a unit in itself, having its own beginning,
development and climacteric situation. Yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
it is progressive and becomes fragmentary
unless considered as an intergral part of
the whole production. Each part (or reel)
of the Long Play accumulates and takes care
of its own situations and complications, which
may tend to pile up revelations of dramatic
interest to heighten the suspense of the reel to
follow, or which may be a direct progressive
result of the reel preceding. In the Long
Play each reel ends with the introduction of
a new complication that necessitates an entirely
new line of treatment. It is literally
“continued in our next.” Each reel must always
advance; it never can go backward. In
each succeeding reel of the Long Play we find
that the story has just received a set-back in its
solution, thru the introduction of a new and
formidable obstacle that demands another line
of solution from that employed in the preceding
reel.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>(<i>EXAMPLE 84.</i>) <i>In “The Coming of the Real
Prince,” the first reel ends with the climacteric situation
showing our heroine really won heart and soul
by the unprincipled villain. But the story cannot
end here; common sense and instinct tell us that
that is not the culmination of the plot. And sure
enough, just as the audience thought the villain was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
going to be caught and thrashed perhaps, by the hero—the
heroine elopes with the villain! Thus we have
the constructive foundation for another reel, that
demands an entirely different course of action.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The studios themselves are usually responsible
for the thrilling or gorgeous spectacles
displaying a wonderful array of scenery,
setting, hordes of actors, marvelous mechanism
and a hundred other entertaining, and
possibly pleasing, features that bear only a
distant relationship to bona fide drama. If
the manufacturer has a menagerie, a railroad,
a thousand pounds of dynamite, a wild west
outfit or a military equipment on his hands he
naturally desires to make use of it. It is then
that the photoplay hack is called upon to write
one or more stories “around” it—and they
usually are considerably around it and seldom
inside of it.</p>

<p>The play offered in the following chapter
is an unpretentious example, falling short of
perfection in more than one particular, tho
equal to the occasion of modestly exemplifying
most of the rules and principles set forth
in the present work.</p>

<p><i>Synopsis</i>:</p>

<p>The matter of a rotten bridge is brought to the
attention of Donnelly, a penurious railroad president,
by Dalton, a conscientious consulting engineer. Donnelly
refuses to listen or heed the report. Dalton
pleads, insists and finally is discharged.</p>

<p>Dalton does not tell his wife of his misfortune.
Failing to get work after two months he is on the
verge of a breakdown. His wife has learned the
truth and sets out at once with their little boy, Arthur,
to her father’s for aid. On the way home
Dalton reads of the terrible train wreck at the very
point he had condemned. Hardly able to think, he
hurries home, finding a note from his wife saying
that she and the child have taken—the train that was
wrecked! More than half-crazed, Dalton hurries to
the scene of the wreck.</p>

<p>Mrs. Donnelly, the sweet wife of the president,
has learned of the wreck and hurries to the scene
to offer aid. With her is her own lovable child,
Florence. It is her car that carries the terribly
maimed little Arthur to the hospital. The child’s leg
is amputated.</p>

<p>Mrs. Donnelly has kept her identity secret, but continues
to bestow every blessing in her power upon
the stricken family. Dalton has gone completely
mad. There seems but one influence under heaven
that makes Arthur want to live, and brings intelligence
and peace to Dalton—that is Florence. They
worship the wonderful little girl.</p>

<p>Dalton’s insanity takes the form of a blind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
obsession. He seeks vengeance on Donnelly. He
learns that Donnelly has an only child. He immediately
sets to work and makes a terrible bomb. He then
plans to telegraph for Mrs. Donnelly and her daughter
and have the train wrecked and the child blown to
atoms on the spot where his child was maimed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Donnelly and Florence are with Arthur when
the telegram is brought by a servant, they just catch
the fatal train. Meanwhile, Dalton has forcibly entered
Donnelly’s office, tells him at the point of a
gun what will happen in less than an hour and waits.
In that hour Donnelly passes thru hell. When there
is but twenty minutes left, Dalton espies the picture
of Florence, realizes that she is the victim, his mind
clears and the men hurry away on the almost hopeless
task of rescue.</p>

<p>It is Dalton who arrives alone, half dead, just as
the train looms up. They ignore his white signal and
he heroically cuts his wrist and saturates the handkerchief
with blood that warns the engineer of danger
the last instant.</p>

<p>Dalton recovers; the men are reconciled; Dalton
gets back his position; Donnelly mends his ways.</p>

<p>THE MOST-USED TERMS DEFINED WITH MANY
SUGGESTIONS FOR REVISION AND ALTERNATIVE
TERMS.</p>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T was but natural that photoplaydom
should be all cluttered up with the crude
material from the workshop where it first saw
the light of the screen—the Studio-Factory.
The Photoplay, step by step, was manufactured.
Ideas, pictures, crude plays and even
playwrights were manufactured! Let the factory
have its own terminology, but do not
cripple technique with it. That day has past
forever, but we have many of the relics
still remaining, most noticeable are those to
be found among the terms applied to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
technique of the photodrama. They all smack
of the factory. There was never a question
of literary quality, value or significance. Many
of them are unique in their homely appropriateness
and should remain. Others are
ridiculous and should be changed. Among
the latter are terms that are without reason,
and which are used with different significance
in different studios. There should be a dignified
standard of universal usage and recognition.
With this aim in view, several suggestions
are offered.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p><i>Action</i>—Specific act of a character; the
Scenario; the combined elements that compose
a drama.</p>

<p><i>Business</i>—The playwright’s instructions to the
actor to perform the expressive acts that
transform him into a character.</p>

<p><i>Bust</i>—(Meaningless, misleading.) See
CLOSE-VIEW.</p>

<p><i>Caption</i>—The interpretive reading line preceding
a Scene, or Sequence, that explains,
excites interest and indicates passage of
time.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Close-Up</i>—(Unliterary; confusing because of
both verbal and adverbal use.) See CLOSE-VIEW.</p>

<p><i>Climax</i>—The supreme moment in the play;
the end toward which all elements tend in
the Plot.</p>

<p><i>Cut-Back</i>—(Really instruction in manufacturing
to cut film and go back; misleading to
playwright who goes only forward.) See
RETURN.</p>

<p><i>Censor</i>—Person employed by National or
Local Board of Censorship to criticize plays
with a view to their moral influence.</p>

<p><i>Chase</i>—An inartistic device in which many
scenes are consumed in showing the pursuit
of one or more characters by others,
and their perilous or ludicrous difficulties.</p>

<p><i>Close-View</i>—The isolated, microscopic or
magnified close view of some important
fragment of action or essential piece of evidence
or reading matter.</p>

<p><i>Co-Incidence</i>—A chance incident, meeting or
discovery that conveniently helps out the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
plot and is obviously unconvincing to the
audience.</p>

<p><i>Crisis</i>—The instant that follows the “planting”
of a Situation and precedes the Solution;
the turning-point when something must
happen.</p>

<p><i>Characters</i>—What the actors should become
in the eyes of the audience.</p>

<p><i>Cast</i>—The list of names, parts and required
characteristics of the characters (in some
cases includes names of actors taking the
parts).</p>

<p><i>Dissolve</i>—To dissolve one scene or character
gradually into another.</p>

<p><i>Director</i>—The person or persons who translate
the playwright’s manuscript into action,
setting and effects by directing the production
of the play, which is simultaneously
photographed.</p>

<p><i>Discover</i>—Means to find a character already
upon a scene when it is thrown upon the
screen: “Douglas discovered at window.”</p>

<p><i>Denouement</i>—That part of the Plot left after
the Climax; the part of the play following<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
the culmination, when “just deserts” are
meted out as a result of the foregoing
action.</p>

<p><i>Dynamic</i>—The visible exercise of force,
violence and physical effects, as opposed to
visualized emotion.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i>—Said of a character as he enters a
scene: “Enter Douglas.”</p>

<p><i>Exit</i>—(Plural EXEUNT.) Said of a character
as he leaves a scene: “Exit Douglas.”</p>

<p><i>Establish</i>—To make certain the relationship
of a character with other characters and
with his surroundings, or to make known
his identity.</p>

<p><i>Episode</i>—An isolated incident not bearing

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
